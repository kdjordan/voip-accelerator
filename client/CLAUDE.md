# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**VoIP Accelerator** - A web application for managing and analyzing VoIP telecommunications data, including rate sheets, LERG data, and pricing comparisons.

**Tech Stack:** Vue 3, TypeScript, Vite, Pinia, TailwindCSS, Supabase, Dexie (IndexedDB)

## Development Commands

```bash
npm run dev           # Start development server (localhost:5173)
npm run build         # Build for production
npm run build:staging # Build for staging environment
npm run preview       # Preview production build
npm run test          # Run tests with Vitest
npm run lint          # Run ESLint
```

## Project Architecture

### Core Structure
- `/src/components/` - Vue components organized by feature (az/, us/, shared/, home/, auth/)
- `/src/stores/` - Pinia state management stores
- `/src/services/` - Business logic and API services
- `/src/workers/` - Web Workers for background processing
- `/src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions (known technical debt area)
- `/src/composables/` - Vue composables for shared logic
- `/src/utils/` - Utility functions

### State Management Architecture

**Important:** AZ and US rate sheets use different storage strategies for performance reasons:

**AZ Rate Sheets:**
- In-memory storage only (no IndexedDB persistence)
- Uses `markRaw()` for memory optimization (50-70% memory reduction)
- Manual reactivity triggers with `triggerDataUpdate()`
- Complex effective date management per destination

**US Rate Sheets:**
- Full IndexedDB persistence with Dexie
- Batch operations with `bulkPut()` in 1000-record chunks
- Worker-based CSV parsing for performance

### Key Features
- Rate sheet upload and processing (CSV/Excel)
- LERG data management and validation
- **Professional NANP categorization system with confidence scoring**
- **+1 destination detection and intelligent filtering**
- **Mixed rate deck handling with user choice modal**
- Bulk adjustment operations with effective date handling
- Performance optimization for datasets with 250K+ records
- Export functionality with conflict resolution
- **Admin diagnostics dashboard for data quality monitoring**

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Vue 3 Composition API with `<script setup>`
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ESLint + Prettier (single quotes, semicolons, 2-space indentation)
- Prefer absolute imports using `@/` alias

### Performance Patterns
- Use `markRaw()` for large datasets in AZ components
- Implement Web Workers for CPU-intensive operations
- Batch IndexedDB operations for US components
- Prevent concurrent operations with `operationInProgress` flags

### Component Patterns
- AZ components have more advanced features (bulk adjustments, effective dates)
- US components focus on simplicity and IndexedDB efficiency
- Feature parity differences are intentional

## Known Technical Debt

### Types System (Priority: Medium)
- 22 type files with mixed constants and type definitions
- Duplicate type definitions across domains
- Inconsistent naming patterns
- TypeScript path aliases point to non-existent directories
- Plan: Address incrementally, not full rewrite

### Documentation Cleanup Needed
- Remove references to deleted `AZAdjustmentMemory.vue` functionality
- Memory management system has been removed from AZ components

## API Configuration

- Vite proxy forwards `/api` requests to `http://localhost:3000`
- Supabase integration for authentication and data persistence
- Environment files: `.env.development`, `.env.staging`, `.env.production`

## Testing

- Vitest configuration with jsdom environment
- Tests in `/tests/` directory include unit, performance, and worker tests
- Chrome with memory profiling recommended for performance testing

## Proven Patterns (Keep Using)

### Memory Optimization (Production-Critical)
```typescript
// Use markRaw() for large datasets to prevent Vue reactivity overhead
this.groupedData = markRaw(data) as GroupedRateData[];

// Manual reactivity triggers when needed
triggerDataUpdate() {
  this.dataUpdateTrigger++;
}

// Prevent concurrent operations
if (this.operationInProgress) return;
this.operationInProgress = true;
```

### Web Worker Patterns
```typescript
// Offload heavy processing to workers
const worker = new Worker('/src/workers/table-sorter.worker.ts');
worker.postMessage({ data: plainData }); // Send plain objects, not reactive proxies

// Handle large CSV processing without blocking UI
Papa.parse(file, {
  worker: true,
  step: (results) => { /* process in chunks */ }
});
```

### Pinia Store Structure
```typescript
export const useStore = defineStore('storeName', {
  state: (): StoreState => ({
    data: [],
    operationInProgress: false,
    excludedItems: new Set<string>(),
  }),
  // Always include operationInProgress for concurrent operation prevention
});
```

### VoIP Domain Patterns
- Rate bucket classification system for telecom data
- Bulk adjustment operations with batch processing
- Effective date management for pricing changes
- LERG data integration with Supabase edge functions
- **Professional NANP (North American Numbering Plan) categorization**
- **Mixed rate deck detection and filtering with user choice modals**
- **Hierarchical data source prioritization (LERG → Constants → Inference)**
- **Confidence scoring for data quality assessment**

### Security & Authentication
```typescript
// Always validate environment variables
if (!supabaseUrl || !supabaseAnonKey) {
  throw new Error('Missing environment variables');
}

// Role-based access patterns
const hasPermission = user.role === 'superadmin' || user.role === 'admin';
```

### Build Configuration (Keep Current)
- Vite manual chunking for better caching
- Web Worker format: 'es' with proper CORS headers
- ESLint flat config with TypeScript and Vue plugins
- Terser minification for production builds

## Development Philosophy

**Ship First, Optimize Later** - This overrides any perfectionist approaches in cursor rules:
- Prioritize user-facing features over internal code cleanup
- Technical debt is acceptable if it doesn't impact users
- Performance over perfect architecture - proven patterns take precedence
- Pragmatic solutions over idealistic patterns

## Production Readiness Notes

- Project name in package.json should be updated from "pricing-tool" to "voip-accelerator"
- Stripe integration still needed for payment processing
- Current architecture is production-ready despite technical debt areas
- Focus on user-facing features over internal code cleanup for initial launch
