## App Overview

The purpose of this app is to be an analytics tool for VOIP carriers and service providers.         

## App Features

-  The ability to upload and compare rate decks for International (AZ) and US domestic (NPANXX) and generate code and pricing reports for the user.
-  The ability to upload multiple AZ and NPANXX rate decks and build new rate decks based on the uploaded decks.
-  The ability to upload CDRs and run them againsr the new rate decks we generate to give the user an idea of how the new rate decks perform.
-  The ability to regeister new users securely and manage existing users.
- There will be a free tier to allow users to try out the app and get a feel for it.
-  There will be a paid tier that will allow users to use the app without the rate deck size and CDR upload limits that the free tier has.
-  There will probably be more features, but this will be V1 of the app.

## Current Status

-  We have scaffolded out some of the app and have some functionality working
-  We are currently running into issues with the app being too tightly coupled and the need to refactor to allow for more flexibility and maintainability.


## Next Steps

-  We need to refactor the app to allow for more flexibility and maintainability.
-  We need to add the functionality for the paid tier.
-  We need to add the functionality for the CDR upload and processing.
-  We need to add the functionality for the reporting.

## Game Plan

### 1. Architectural Refactoring
- [ x] Create domain-driven design structure
  - [ x] Separate AZ and NPANXX domains
  - [ x] Create shared utilities domain
  - [ x] Implement clean interfaces between domains
- [ ] Implement service layer pattern
  - [ ] CSV processing service
  - [ ] Rate deck analysis service
  - [ ] CDR processing service
  - [ ] User management service
- [ ] Improve state management
  - [ x] Separate concerns in stores
  - [ x ] Implement proper TypeScript interfaces
  - [ x ] Add state persistence strategy

### 2. Core Features Enhancement

### 6. Documentation & Deployment
- [ ] Technical Documentation
  - [ ] API documentation
  - [ ] Component documentation
  - [ ] Architecture diagrams
- [ ] User Documentation
  - [ ] User guides
  - [ ] API documentation
  - [ ] Tutorial videos
- [ ] Deployment
  - [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
  - [ ] Configure production environment
