# Phase 1 Implementation Summary - Memory Optimization

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Added `markRaw` to Prevent Deep Reactivity

The main change was to use Vue's `markRaw` function to prevent Vue from making large data arrays deeply reactive. This was applied to:

- `originalData` array
- `groupedData` array
- All updates to these arrays

### 2. Key Changes in `az-rate-sheet-store.ts`

```typescript
// Import markRaw from Vue
import { markRaw } from 'vue';

// When setting data, wrap with markRaw
setGroupedData(data: GroupedRateData[]) {
  this.groupedData = markRaw(data) as GroupedRateData[];
}

setOriginalData(data: RateSheetRecord[]) {
  const processedData = data.map((record) => ({...}));
  this.originalData = markRaw(processedData) as RateSheetRecord[];
}
```

### 3. Added `triggerDataUpdate()` Method

Since the data is no longer deeply reactive, we added a method to manually trigger updates when needed:

```typescript
triggerDataUpdate() {
  // Force reactivity update by creating a new array reference
  this.groupedData = [...this.groupedData];
}
```

This method is called after bulk operations to ensure components are notified of changes.

### 4. Memory Monitoring Utilities

Added `client/src/utils/memory-test.ts` with:

- `MemoryMonitor` class for taking memory snapshots
- `isReactive()` helper to check if objects are reactive
- `logReactivityStatus()` helper to log reactivity information

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Enable Chrome Memory Profiling

Run Chrome with the flag to enable precise memory info:

```bash
# macOS
open -a "Google Chrome" --args --enable-precise-memory-info

# Windows
chrome.exe --enable-precise-memory-info

# Linux
google-chrome --enable-precise-memory-info
```

### 2. Test the Implementation

1. Open the application in the Chrome instance with memory profiling enabled
2. Navigate to the AZ Rate Sheet page
3. Open Chrome DevTools Console
4. Upload a large CSV file (1.6MB or larger)
5. Watch the console for memory monitoring output

### 3. Expected Console Output

You should see:

```
Memory Snapshot - Before File Processing: {usedHeap: "XX.XX MB", ...}
Processing file with column mapping: {...}
After Processing - groupedData - Reactivity Status: {isReactive: false, ...}
After Processing - originalData - Reactivity Status: {isReactive: false, ...}
Memory Snapshot - After File Processing: {usedHeap: "XX.XX MB", ...}
Memory Difference (Before File Processing â†’ After File Processing): {heapDifference: "+XX.XX MB", ...}
```

### 4. Verify Memory Reduction

1. Take a Chrome DevTools Memory Heap Snapshot before uploading
2. Upload the CSV file
3. Take another Heap Snapshot after upload completes
4. Compare the two snapshots

**Expected Results:**

- Memory usage should be significantly lower (50-70% reduction)
- The `isReactive: false` in console logs confirms markRaw is working
- Components should still function normally

## What Components Were NOT Changed

All components continue to work exactly as before:

- `AZRateSheetView.vue` - Only added memory monitoring
- `AZRateSheetTable.vue` - No changes
- `AZEffectiveDates.vue` - No changes
- `AZGlobalAdjustment.vue` - No changes
- `AZBucketBulkAdjustment.vue` - No changes
- `az-rate-sheet.service.ts` - No changes

## Potential Issues to Watch For

1. **Reactivity Updates**: Some components might not update immediately after bulk operations. The `triggerDataUpdate()` method should handle this.

2. **Worker Communication**: Workers should continue to work normally as they receive plain objects, not reactive proxies.

3. **Filtering/Sorting**: These operations should work normally as they create new arrays.

## Next Steps

If Phase 1 is successful:

- Phase 2: Remove the duplicate `getGroupedData` getter
- Phase 3: Implement smart caching
- Phase 4: Optimize worker communication
- Phase 5: Implement string interning

## Rollback Instructions

If issues are encountered, simply remove `markRaw` calls:

```typescript
// Change this:
this.groupedData = markRaw(data) as GroupedRateData[];

// Back to this:
this.groupedData = data;
```

And remove the `triggerDataUpdate()` calls.
