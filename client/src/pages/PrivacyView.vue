        <p>
          VOIP Accelerator ("us", "we", or "our") operates the VOIP Accelerator website and service (the
          "Service"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and
          disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated
          with that data.
        </p>

        <p>
          We are committed to protecting your privacy. We use your data to provide and improve the
          Service. By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in
          accordance with this policy. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used
          in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, accessible
          from https://voipaccelerator.com/terms-and-conditions.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-accent">1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>
          We collect several different types of information for various purposes to provide and
          improve our Service to you.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-fbWhite/80">Types of Data Collected</h3>

        <h4>Personal Data</h4>
        <p>
          While using our Service, especially during account registration and subscription, we may
          ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to
          contact or identify you ("Personal Data"). Personally identifiable information may
          include, but is not limited to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Email address</li>
          <li>First name and last name</li>
          <li>Billing information (handled by our payment processor, Stripe)</li>
          <li>Usage Data (as described below)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>User Content (Rate Decks, LERG Data, Reports)</h4>
        <p>
          A core feature of VOIP Accelerator involves processing data you upload, such as VOIP rate
          decks, and data generated through the service, like comparisons and reports ("User
          Content").
          <strong
            >This User Content is primarily processed and stored locally in your web browser's
            IndexedDB storage.</strong
          >
          We do not typically transmit, store, or access your raw rate decks or the specific results
          of your comparisons on our servers.
        </p>

        <h4>Usage Data</h4>
        <p>
          We may also collect information on how the Service is accessed and used ("Usage Data").
          This Usage Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol address
          (e.g., IP address), browser type, browser version, the pages of our Service that you
          visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, unique device
          identifiers, and other diagnostic data. This data is typically aggregated and anonymized
          to help us understand service usage patterns and improve functionality.
        </p>

        <h4>Tracking & Cookies Data</h4>
        <p>
          We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to track the activity on our Service and
          hold certain information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cookies are files with small amount of data which may include an anonymous unique
          identifier. Cookies are sent to your browser from a website and stored on your device.
          Tracking technologies also used are beacons, tags, and scripts to collect and track
          information and to improve and analyze our Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being
          sent. However, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of
          our Service (like staying logged in).
        </p>
        <p>Examples of Cookies we use:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Session Cookies:</strong> We use Session Cookies to operate our Service (e.g.,
            authentication).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Preference Cookies:</strong> We use Preference Cookies to remember your
            preferences and various settings.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Security Cookies:</strong> We use Security Cookies for security purposes.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Analytics Cookies:</strong> We may use privacy-friendly analytics tools (such as
            Plausible or Supabase Analytics) to track anonymous usage data for improving the
            Service.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-accent">2. Use of Data</h2>
        <p>VOIP Accelerator uses the collected data for various purposes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            To provide and maintain our Service (including processing data locally in your browser)
          </li>
          <li>To manage your account and subscription</li>
          <li>To notify you about changes to our Service</li>
          <li>To provide customer support</li>
          <li>
            To gather analysis or valuable information so that we can improve our Service (primarily
            using anonymized Usage Data)
          </li>
          <li>To monitor the usage of our Service</li>
          <li>To detect, prevent and address technical issues</li>
          <li>To process payments through our third-party payment processor (Stripe)</li>
          <li>
            To communicate with you, including sending service-related emails, invoices, and
            potentially marketing communications (which you can opt-out of)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-accent">3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <h4>Local Storage (IndexedDB)</h4>
        <p>
          As mentioned, your primary User Content (rate decks, comparisons, reports) is stored
          locally within your browser's IndexedDB. The security of this data depends on the security
          of your own device and browser environment. Clearing your browser's cache or site data may
          remove this locally stored information.
        </p>
        <h4>Server-Side Storage</h4>
        <p>
          Your account information (like email, name, subscription status) and potentially
          aggregated/anonymized Usage Data are stored on secure servers. We take reasonable measures
          to protect this information.
        </p>
        <p>
          The security of your data is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission
          over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use
          commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its
          absolute security.
        </p>

        <h4>Data Retention</h4>
        <p>
          We retain account-related information for as long as your account is active or as needed
          to comply with legal obligations. IndexedDB-stored data is only accessible on your device
          and is not retained by us.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-accent">4. Data Transfer & Third-Party Processors</h2>
        <p>
          Your information, including Personal Data, may be transferred to — and maintained on —
          computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental
          jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ than those from your jurisdiction.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are located outside United States and choose to provide information to us, please
          note that we transfer the data, including Personal Data, to United States and process it
          there.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information
          represents your agreement to that transfer.
        </p>
        <p>
          VOIP Accelerator will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is
          treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and no transfer of your
          Personal Data will take place to an organization or a country unless there are adequate
          controls in place including the security of your data and other personal information.
        </p>

        <h4>Payment Processing</h4>
        <p>
          We use Stripe for payment processing. We do not store your full credit card details on our
          servers. Stripe handles this information securely. Stripe's use of your personal
          information is governed by their Privacy Policy, which can be viewed at
          <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >https://stripe.com/privacy</a
          >.
        </p>
        <!-- Add other third-party processors if applicable (e.g., email service, analytics) -->

        <h2 class="text-accent">5. Disclosure of Data</h2>
        <p>
          VOIP Accelerator may disclose your Personal Data in the good faith belief that such action
          is necessary to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>To comply with a legal obligation</li>
          <li>To protect and defend the rights or property of VOIP Accelerator</li>
          <li>To prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service</li>
          <li>To protect the personal safety of users of the Service or the public</li>
          <li>To protect against legal liability</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-accent">6. Your Data Protection Rights</h2>
        <p>
          Depending on your location, you may have certain data protection rights. VOIP Accelerator
          aims to take reasonable steps to allow you to correct, amend, delete, or limit the use of
          your Personal Data.
        </p>
        <p>

        <p>

          requests.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-accent">7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 18 ("Children").</p>
        <p>
          We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age
          of 18. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us
          with Personal Data, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected Personal
          Data from children without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that
          information from our servers.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-accent">8. Links To Other Sites</h2>
