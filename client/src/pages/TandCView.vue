        <p>
          Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") carefully before
          using the VOIP Accelerator website and service (the "Service") operated by VOIP Accelerator ("us", "we", or "our").
        </p>

        <p>
          Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned upon your acceptance of and
          compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who wish
          to access or use the Service. By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by
          these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you do not have permission to
          access the Service.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-accent">1. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>
          VOIP Accelerator provides tools for analyzing, comparing, and managing Voice over IP
          (VOIP) rate decks and related telecommunications data. The Service allows users to upload
          data, perform comparisons, leverage LERG lookups, and export reports, primarily operating
          within the user's browser for enhanced data privacy.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-accent">2. Accounts</h2>
        <p>
          When you create an account with us, you guarantee that the information you provide us is
          accurate, complete, and current at all times. Inaccurate, incomplete, or obsolete
          information may result in the immediate termination of your account on the Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password,
          including but not limited to the restriction of access to your computer and/or account.
          You agree to accept responsibility for any and all activities or actions that occur under
          your account and/or password. You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any
          breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-accent">3. Billing and Payment</h2>
        <p>
          The Service is offered on a subscription basis. You will be billed in advance on a
          recurring, periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a
          <strong>monthly</strong> or <strong>annual</strong> basis, depending on the subscription
          plan you select when purchasing a subscription.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the end of each Billing Cycle, your subscription will automatically renew under the
          exact same conditions unless you cancel it or VOIP Accelerator cancels it. You may cancel
          your subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by
          contacting VOIP Accelerator customer support team.
        </p>
        <p>
          A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your
          subscription. You shall provide VOIP Accelerator with accurate and complete billing
          information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid
          payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically
          authorize VOIP Accelerator to charge all subscription fees incurred through your account
          to any such payment instruments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, VOIP Accelerator will issue an
          electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline
          date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the
          invoice.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Fee Changes:</strong> VOIP Accelerator in its sole discretion and at any time, may
          modify the subscription fees. Any subscription fee change will become effective at the end
          of the then-current Billing Cycle. We will provide you with reasonable prior notice of any
          change in subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your subscription
          before such change becomes effective.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Refunds:</strong> Except when required by law, paid subscription fees are
          non-refundable. Certain refund requests for subscriptions may be considered by VOIP
          Accelerator on a case-by-case basis and granted at the sole discretion of VOIP
          Accelerator. Certain jurisdictions may allow limited refunds; we will comply with
          applicable local laws.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-accent">4. Data Privacy and Security</h2>
        <p>
          VOIP Accelerator is designed with user privacy in mind. Most data processing, including
          rate deck analysis and comparisons, occurs locally within your browser using IndexedDB.
          Uploaded files and derived data are generally not transmitted to our servers, except where
          necessary for specific features explicitly indicated (e.g., account management). Account
          information, including email and subscription status (but excluding payment card details),
          is securely stored using trusted third-party infrastructure such as Supabase. Please refer
          to our Privacy Policy for more details on how we handle your data.

          device and browser environment.
