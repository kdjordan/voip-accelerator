# Performance Optimization

## Core Questions

### Client-Side Performance
1. What are our target performance metrics (FCP, LCP, TTI)?
2. How should we implement code splitting?
3. What assets need to be optimized?
4. What caching strategies should we use for static assets?

### Data Loading
1. What is the maximum acceptable initial load time?
2. How should we implement progressive loading?
3. Should we implement virtual scrolling for large datasets?
4. What preloading strategies should we implement?

### IndexedDB Optimization
1. What is the optimal IndexedDB schema for our use case?
2. How should we handle large dataset queries?
3. What indexing strategy should we use?
4. How do we optimize write operations?

### Memory Management
1. What is our target memory footprint?
2. How should we handle large dataset processing?
3. When should we implement cleanup operations?
4. How do we prevent memory leaks?

### Network Optimization
1. What data should be cached?
2. How should we handle slow network conditions?
3. What compression techniques should we use?
4. How do we optimize API requests?

### Computation Optimization
1. Which operations need to be moved to Web Workers?
2. How should we handle CPU-intensive tasks?
3. What operations can be deferred or batched?
4. How do we optimize complex calculations?

### Monitoring & Analytics
1. What performance metrics should we track?
2. How do we implement performance monitoring?
3. What alerting thresholds should we set?
4. How do we track user-perceived performance?

### Testing & Validation
1. What performance testing tools should we use?
2. How do we test with different device profiles?
3. What are our performance budgets?
4. How do we validate performance improvements?
