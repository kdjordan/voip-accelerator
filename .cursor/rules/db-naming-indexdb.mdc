When storing our user provided data in IndexDeb, we use the composable [useDexieDB.ts](mdc:client/src/composables/useDexieDB.ts)
We have names for the individaul file upload zones that recieve these files :
- for AZ CSVs we use az1 and az2
- for US CSVs we use us1 and us2

Actual object store names (tables) are derived from the name of the file uploaded.
We remove the .csv extension however.
Example : if we upload a file named UStest.csv, we store it in the us_rate_deck_db in the object store 'ustest'
These values are mapped in @us-store and [az-store.ts](mdc:client/src/stores/az-store.ts) respectively using the filesUploaded state Map.

So the names of our dbs that will be present in the app are :
az_rate_deck_db : for user uploaded AZ rate decks
us_rate_deck_db : for user uploadedc US rate CSVs
lerg_db : for data copied down from Supabase that has the latest LERG data
rate_sheet_db : for user uploaded rate sheets 
us_pricing_comparison_db : for app generated comparisons for us_rate_deck_db tables that were uploaded by the user

these are defined in [app-types.ts](mdc:client/src/types/app-types.ts)
```
export const DBName = {
  AZ: 'az_rate_deck_db',
  US: 'us_rate_deck_db',
  LERG: 'lerg_db',
  RATE_SHEET: 'rate_sheet_db',
  US_PRICING_COMPARISON: 'us_pricing_comparison_db',
} as const;
```
