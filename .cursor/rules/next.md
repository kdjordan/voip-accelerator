# Refine A-Z Functionality & Integrate International Data

## Summary of Accomplishments

- **DexieDB Foundation:** Successfully refactored A-Z file processing to use DexieDB for storing rate deck data (`az_rate_deck_db`) and detailed comparison results (`az_pricing_comparison_db`).
- **Dynamic Schemas:** Resolved the critical issue in `useDexieDB.ts` where schemas were hardcoded. The composable now correctly applies dynamic schemas based on the `dbName`.
- **Worker Consolidation:** Combined AZ report generation into a single worker (`az-comparison.worker.ts`) called by `AZService::makeAzCombinedReport`.
- **Store Refactoring:** Cleaned up `az-store.ts` to remove legacy in-memory storage and align state management with the DexieDB-first approach.
- **Sample Data Loading:** Successfully debugged and fixed the AZ sample data loading process in `load-sample-data.ts`.
- **‚úÖ Manual Uploads Fixed:** Resolved issues preventing manual AZ file uploads and re-uploads after removal, including fixing Dexie connection instability caused by `deleteStore()`.
- **‚úÖ Legacy Code Cleanup:** Identified and removed the unused `client/src/services/dexie` directory. Fixed `client/src/composables/useLergData.ts` to use the correct `LergService` singleton and methods.

## Current Status

- **‚úÖ AZ File Upload:** Both sample data loading and manual user uploads (including removal and re-upload) for AZ rate decks (`az_rate_deck_db`) are now working reliably.
- **‚öôÔ∏è Comparison Logic:** The basic structure for generating and storing AZ comparisons (`az_pricing_comparison_db`) is in place but needs review and refinement.
- **üßπ Codebase:** Legacy Dexie service structure removed, relevant composables updated.

## Next Phase Goals

1.  **Integrate International Country Data:** Convert the static `int-countries.json` into a TypeScript constant file (`int-country-codes.ts`) for easy lookup and use within the application, particularly for enriching AZ reports.
2.  **Refine AZ Comparison Logic:** Review and potentially refactor the AZ comparison generation, storage, and display (`az_pricing_comparison_db`, worker, service, UI) to ensure robustness and align with established US patterns where beneficial.
3.  **Verify AZ Worker & Finalize Cleanup:** Confirm the AZ comparison worker runs correctly and complete any remaining cleanup tasks (e.g., finalizing the `removeTable` comparison deletion strategy).

## Action Items & Checklist

### 1. International Country Data Integration

- [x] **Define TypeScript Interface:** Create an interface (`IntCountryInfo`) in `client/src/types/domains/intl-types.ts` (or a new dedicated file like `client/src/types/domains/intl-types.ts`?) to represent the structure of each country entry (e.g., `countryName: string`, `isoCode: string`, `dialCode: number | string`).
  - _**(Prompt):** What should the exact field names and types be for the `IntCountryInfo` interface? Should `dialCode` be a `number`, `string`, or handle multiple codes like the Dominican Republic (`1809, 1829, 1849`)? How should the `ISO CODE` (`AF / AFG`) be stored - just the 2-letter code, 3-letter code, or both?_
    //// The interface should be dialCode: string, countryName: string, isoCode: string, dialCode: 'Array of strings for multiple codes'
    /// We should store the 2 character ISO code
- [x] **Convert JSON to TS Constant:**
  - Create a new file: `client/src/types/constants/int-country-codes.ts`.
  - Read `client/src/data/int-countries.json`.
  - Transform the JSON array into a TypeScript `Record<string, IntCountryInfo>` where the key is the 2-letter ISO code (or country name?) for efficient lookup.
  - Export the constant (e.g., `INT_COUNTRY_CODES`) and potentially helper functions (e.g., `getCountryInfoByIsoCode(code: string): IntCountryInfo | undefined`, `getDialCode(code: string): string | number | undefined`).
  - _**(Prompt):** What should be the primary key for the `INT_COUNTRY_CODES` Record? The 2-letter ISO code seems standard, similar to `COUNTRY_CODES`. Agree?_
    ///Since the user will primarily be looking up INT countries by dialCode or Country name, the CountryName should be the primary key.
- [ ] **(Next Step):** Integrate lookup logic into AZ report generation/display.
  - _**(Prompt):** Where exactly in the AZ processing/display flow will this country information be used? (e.g., In the worker? In the UI component? In the `AZService`?)_

### 2. AZ Worker Verification

- [ ] **Confirm Worker Instantiation & Execution:** Test the "Generate Reports" button (which triggers `AZService::makeAzCombinedReport`).
  - Does the worker (`az-comparison.worker.ts`) run without errors?
  - Does it successfully receive data, perform the comparison, and post back results (`pricingReport`, `codeReport`, `detailedComparisonData`)?
  - Check browser console for worker logs and any errors during report generation.

### 3. AZ Comparison Logic Review & Refinement

- [ ] **Review `AZService::makeAzCombinedReport`:**
  - _**(Prompt):** Does the current logic (load data -> run worker -> store summaries -> store detailed data -> update store) seem robust and handle potential errors well?_ yes
  - _**(Prompt):** How does this compare to `us.service.ts::processComparisons`? Should we adopt any patterns from the US service?_ i think this should work, if we need to adjust for performace, we wi
- [ ] **Review `az-comparison.worker.ts`:**
  - _**(Prompt):** Is the core comparison logic efficient and accurate? Does it correctly handle edge cases?_ i believe so yes
- [ ] **Review `az_pricing_comparison_db` & `AZDetailedComparisonEntry`:**
  - _**(Prompt):** Is the current schema sufficient? Does the US comparison (`us_pricing_comparison_db`) store detailed results similarly? Should the AZ schema align more closely?_
- [ ] **Review Report UI (`AZPricingReport.vue`, `AZCodeReport.vue`):**
  - _**(Prompt):** How should loading states and errors be handled? Is the detailed comparison display clear?_

### 4. Finalize AZ Cleanup

- [ ] **Implement `AZService::removeTable` Comparison Deletion:**
  - Finalize the logic to delete corresponding comparison table(s) from `az_pricing_comparison_db` when a rate deck table is removed.
  - _**(Prompt - Decision Needed):** When `azfile1` is removed, how to determine comparison table names (e.g., `azfile1_vs_azfile2`, `azfile2_vs_azfile1`) to delete?_
    - _Option A: Check `azStore.filesUploaded` for the other filename._
    - _Option B: Store the generated `detailedComparisonTableName` in `azStore`._
    - _Option C: Query `az_pricing_comparison_db` for table names containing `tableName` (less precise)._
    - _Which approach? (Leaning towards A or B)._ A

## AI Context & Debugging Log (Updated)

- **Focus:** Refactoring AZ to use DexieDB, cleaning up legacy code, preparing for international data integration.
- **Resolution:** Manual AZ uploads fixed. Legacy Dexie service removed. `useLergData.ts` updated to use `LergService` singleton. Created `IntCountryInfo` interface and `INT_COUNTRY_CODES` constant from JSON data.
- **Next:** Integrate `INT_COUNTRY_CODES` lookups into the AZ workflow, then proceed with AZ worker verification and comparison logic refinement.

## Build AZ Enhanced Code Report Functionality (New Phase)

**Goal:** Replicate the single-file code summary functionality seen in `USCodeSummary.vue` for A-Z files, providing detailed statistics and country-based coverage analysis. This requires creating a new enhanced report structure, a worker to generate it, and a UI component to display it.

**Context:** We have successfully integrated `INT_COUNTRY_CODES` for looking up international country data. Now, we need to leverage this, along with uploaded A-Z file data, to generate a comprehensive single-file analysis report, similar to the `USEnhancedCodeReport` generated by `us-npa-analyzer.worker.ts`.

### Implementation Phases & Checklist

**Phase 1: Types & Store Foundation**

- [x] **Define Interfaces:** Add `AZEnhancedCodeReport`, `AZFileInfo`, `AZCodeStats`, `AZDestinationStats`, and `AZCountryBreakdown` interfaces to `client/src/types/domains/az-types.ts`.
- [x] **Update Store:** Modify `client/src/stores/az-store.ts` to include state, getters, and actions for `enhancedCodeReports`.

**Phase 2: Worker Implementation**

- [x] **Create Worker File:** Create `client/src/workers/az-analyzer.worker.ts`.
- [x] **Implement Worker Logic:** Add the core logic to the worker to process input data (`fileName`, `fileData`, `intCountryData`) and generate the `AZEnhancedCodeReport`.
- [x] **Worker Input/Output:** Ensure correct message handling for input data and posting the resulting report.

**Phase 3: Service Integration**

- [x] **Update `AZService.ts`:** Modify the file processing function to:
  - Retrieve necessary data (`AZStandardizedData[]`, `INT_COUNTRY_CODES`).
  - Instantiate the `az-analyzer.worker.ts`.
  - Post data to the worker.
  - Listen for the worker's response.
  - Call `azStore.setEnhancedCodeReport` with the received report.

**Phase 4: UI Component Development**

- [x] **Create Component File:** Create `client/src/components/az/AZCodeSummary.vue`.
- [x] **Component Structure:** Set up the `<template>` and `<script setup>` with props (`componentId`).
- [x] **Data Fetching:** Get the `fileName` and `AZEnhancedCodeReport` from the `azStore` based on the `componentId`.
- [x] **Static Rendering:** Render the basic statistics (Total Codes, Code Stats, Destination Stats) using Tailwind CSS.
- [x] **Country Coverage Section (Basic):** Display basic list of countries with search input.
- [x] **Refactor Country Coverage Data:** Update worker (`az-analyzer.worker.ts`), types (`az-types.ts`), and UI (`AzCodeSummary.vue`) to show detailed, expandable destination/dial code breakdown per country.
  - [x] Update `AZCountryBreakdown` interface.
  - [x] Modify worker logic to group by destination name and collect dial codes.
  - [x] Implement expandable UI in `AzCodeSummary.vue`.
- [x] **Search/Filtering:** Add filtering logic for the _refined_ country coverage list.
  - _Learning:_ Initial worker logic used exact dial code matching, missing breakouts with longer codes. Refactored worker to use **longest-prefix matching** against `intCountryData`. Refined UI search to use `startsWith()` for dial code queries to ensure only relevant breakouts are shown.

**Phase 5: Integration & Testing**

- [ ] **Integrate Component:** Add `<AZCodeSummary>` to the appropriate parent component/view.
- [ ] **Testing:** Thoroughly test the entire workflow: file upload -> worker execution -> store update -> UI display, expansion, and filtering.

## Refined Plan for AZCountryBreakdown

Based on user feedback, we need to refine the `AZCountryBreakdown` interface in `az-types.ts` to support an expandable UI that groups dial codes by specific destination names (or "breakouts") within a country, distinguishing between types like fixed and cellular networks.

**Refined Requirements:**

1.  **Structure:** The `AZCountryBreakdown` for each country should contain a list of its breakouts found in the file. Each breakout needs to store its name (e.g., "AFGHANISTAN CELLULAR AREEBA MTN") and the list of unique dial codes associated _specifically_ with that breakout name in the uploaded file.
2.  **Counting:** We need a count of the _unique breakouts_ (destination names) found for the country within the file. The old `coveragePercent` concept is less relevant; the focus is on the number and details of these breakouts.
3.  **Data Source:** The worker (`az-analyzer.worker.ts`) will be responsible for analyzing the `AZStandardizedData[]` and grouping the dial codes by country and then by the exact destination name string found in the rate deck. It will use `INT_COUNTRY_CODES` primarily for mapping dial codes back to the parent country ISO/name.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Update `az-types.ts`:** Modify the `AZCountryBreakdown` interface (and potentially add a new `AZBreakoutDetail` interface) to match these refined requirements.
2.  **Refactor Worker:** Update `az-analyzer.worker.ts` to generate the report according to the new structure, correctly identifying and grouping breakouts and their associated dial codes.
3.  **Update UI:** Adapt `AzCodeSummary.vue` to display the expandable list using the new data structure.

## UI Refinement & Data Corrections (Completed)

- **Completed:**
  - Refactored `AZFileUploads.vue` and `AzCodeSummary.vue`:
    - The `AzCodeSummary` now replaces the drop zone view after a file is successfully processed.
    - Removed redundant spacing/borders from `AzCodeSummary` as layout is handled by the parent.
  - Aligned the "Remove" button horizontally with the filename pill inside the `AzCodeSummary` header for better UX.
  - Updated `int-country-codes.ts`: Added entries for "Norfolk Island", "Abkhazia", and specific A.E.T. Antarctica bases (Casey, Davis, Macquarie, Mawson) to ensure correct identification and grouping by the `az-analyzer.worker.ts`.

---

## Dexie Versioning & Comparison Storage Fix (Completed)

- **Completed:**
  - Resolved Dexie schema/versioning conflicts for `az_pricing_comparison_db`.
  - Refactored `az.service.ts::makeAzCombinedReport` to directly manage the fixed `az_comparison_results` table (clearing and bulk-putting data) instead of using the `storeInDexieDB` composable for this specific table.
  - This mirrors the successful pattern used in `us.service.ts` and eliminates the `Dexie SchemaDiff` warnings.

---

## Next Focus: AZ Pricing Report UI & Data Integration

- **Current Focus:** Refactor `AZPricingReport.vue` & `AZDetailedComparisonTable.vue`.
- **Completed:**
  - **Created `AZDetailedComparisonTable.vue`:** Modeled after the US version, responsible for fetching and displaying detailed AZ comparison data.
  - **Integrated into `AZPricingReport.vue`:** Added the new component and removed redundant data fetching logic from the parent.
  - **Added `AZService::getPagedDetailedComparisonData`:** Implemented the necessary service method for pagination and filtering.
  - **Dynamic Headers:** Updated table headers in `AZDetailedComparisonTable.vue` to display actual filenames retrieved from `azStore`.
  - **Styled Headers:** Removed `.csv` extensions and applied theme colors (green/blue), padding, borders, and rounding to filenames in headers for a clearer, button-like appearance.
- **Next Objective: Consolidate Summary Insights & Integrate Unmatched Codes**

**Goal:** Remove the separate expandable summary sections (Sell, Buy, Same, Unmatched) from `AZPricingReport.vue` and modify the `AZDetailedComparisonTable.vue` and its underlying data generation process to display all relevant information (including codes present in only one file) within a single, filterable table.

**Implementation Steps:**

**Phase 1: Data Structure & Generation**

1.  **Update Type `AZDetailedComparisonEntry` (`az-types.ts`):**
    - Make `destName1`, `rate1`, `destName2`, `rate2` optional (`?`) to accommodate entries present in only one file.
    - Consider adding a new field, e.g., `matchStatus: 'both' | 'file1_only' | 'file2_only'`, to explicitly track if the code was matched in both files or only one.
2.  **Refactor Worker (`az-comparison.worker.ts`):**
    - Modify the core comparison logic to identify codes present in only File 1 or only File 2.
    - Generate `AZDetailedComparisonEntry` objects for these unmatched codes, populating the relevant file's data and leaving the other file's fields empty (or setting them to `null`/`undefined`).
    - Populate the new `matchStatus` field accordingly.
    - Ensure the worker correctly posts back the combined list containing matched and unmatched entries.
3.  **Update DB Schema (`DBSchemas` in `app-types.ts` & Service):**
    - Adjust the Dexie schema definition for the `az_comparison_results` table in `DBSchemas` to reflect the optional fields (if Dexie syntax requires it, though usually `++id` suffices) and potentially add an index for the new `matchStatus` field if filtering by it will be common.
    - Review `AZService::makeAzCombinedReport` to ensure it handles storing the updated `AZDetailedComparisonEntry` structure correctly (it should likely work as is with `bulkPut`, but worth a check).

**Phase 2: UI Adaptation**

4.  **Enhance Table Filters (`AZDetailedComparisonTable.vue`):**
    - Modify or add filters to allow users to view specific scenarios:
      - **Sell:** `cheaperFile === 'file2'` (already exists).
      - **Buy:** `cheaperFile === 'file1'` (already exists).
      - **Same:** `cheaperFile === 'same'` (already exists).
      - **Unmatched (File 1 only):** New filter option, possibly using the `matchStatus` field (`matchStatus === 'file1_only'`).
      - **Unmatched (File 2 only):** New filter option, possibly using the `matchStatus` field (`matchStatus === 'file2_only'`).
    - Decide on the best UI for these filters (e.g., modify the existing 'Cheaper Rate' dropdown, add a new 'Match Status' dropdown).
5.  **Update Table Display (`AZDetailedComparisonTable.vue`):**
    - Ensure the table correctly displays rows where one file's data is missing (e.g., showing 'N/A' or an empty cell instead of `undefined`).
    - Consider adding a visual indicator (maybe a new column or styling) for the `matchStatus`.
6.  **Remove Summary Sections (`AZPricingReport.vue`):**
    - Delete the four `<div>` elements corresponding to the Sell, Buy, Same, and Unmatched expandable sections.
    - Remove any associated computed properties or logic used solely by these sections.

**Phase 3: Testing**

7.  **Verify Data:** Ensure the comparison worker generates the correct combined data, including unmatched codes with appropriate null/undefined fields and the correct `matchStatus`.
8.  **Test Filters:** Thoroughly test all filter combinations in the UI to confirm they show the expected subsets of data (Sell, Buy, Same, Unmatched File 1, Unmatched File 2, All).
9.  **Test Display:** Check the table rendering for rows with missing data.
