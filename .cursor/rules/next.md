# Refine A-Z Functionality & Integrate International Data

## Summary of Accomplishments

- **DexieDB Foundation:** Successfully refactored A-Z file processing to use DexieDB for storing rate deck data (`az_rate_deck_db`) and detailed comparison results (`az_pricing_comparison_db`).
- **Dynamic Schemas:** Resolved the critical issue in `useDexieDB.ts` where schemas were hardcoded. The composable now correctly applies dynamic schemas based on the `dbName`.
- **Worker Consolidation:** Combined AZ report generation into a single worker (`az-comparison.worker.ts`) called by `AZService::makeAzCombinedReport`.
- **Store Refactoring:** Cleaned up `az-store.ts` to remove legacy in-memory storage and align state management with the DexieDB-first approach.
- **Sample Data Loading:** Successfully debugged and fixed the AZ sample data loading process in `load-sample-data.ts`.
- **‚úÖ Manual Uploads Fixed:** Resolved issues preventing manual AZ file uploads and re-uploads after removal, including fixing Dexie connection instability caused by `deleteStore()`.
- **‚úÖ Legacy Code Cleanup:** Identified and removed the unused `client/src/services/dexie` directory. Fixed `client/src/composables/useLergData.ts` to use the correct `LergService` singleton and methods.

---

## Current Status

- **‚úÖ AZ File Upload:** Both sample data loading and manual user uploads (including removal and re-upload) for AZ rate decks (`az_rate_deck_db`) are now working reliably.
- **‚öôÔ∏è Comparison Logic:** The basic structure for generating and storing AZ comparisons (`az_pricing_comparison_db`) is in place but needs review and refinement.
- **üßπ Codebase:** Legacy Dexie service structure removed, relevant composables updated.

## Next Phase Goals

1.  **Integrate International Country Data:** Convert the static `int-countries.json` into a TypeScript constant file (`int-country-codes.ts`) for easy lookup and use within the application, particularly for enriching AZ reports.
2.  **Refine AZ Comparison Logic:** Review and potentially refactor the AZ comparison generation, storage, and display (`az_pricing_comparison_db`, worker, service, UI) to ensure robustness and align with established US patterns where beneficial.
3.  **Verify AZ Worker & Finalize Cleanup:** Confirm the AZ comparison worker runs correctly and complete any remaining cleanup tasks (e.g., finalizing the `removeTable` comparison deletion strategy).

---

## Action Items & Checklist

### 1. International Country Data Integration

- [x] **Define TypeScript Interface:** Create an interface (`IntCountryInfo`) in `client/src/types/domains/intl-types.ts` (or a new dedicated file like `client/src/types/domains/intl-types.ts`?) to represent the structure of each country entry (e.g., `countryName: string`, `isoCode: string`, `dialCode: number | string`).
  - _**(Prompt):** What should the exact field names and types be for the `IntCountryInfo` interface? Should `dialCode` be a `number`, `string`, or handle multiple codes like the Dominican Republic (`1809, 1829, 1849`)? How should the `ISO CODE` (`AF / AFG`) be stored - just the 2-letter code, 3-letter code, or both?_
    //// The interface should be dialCode: string, countryName: string, isoCode: string, dialCode: 'Array of strings for multiple codes'
    /// We should store the 2 character ISO code
- [x] **Convert JSON to TS Constant:**
  - Create a new file: `client/src/types/constants/int-country-codes.ts`.
  - Read `client/src/data/int-countries.json`.
  - Transform the JSON array into a TypeScript `Record<string, IntCountryInfo>` where the key is the 2-letter ISO code (or country name?) for efficient lookup.
  - Export the constant (e.g., `INT_COUNTRY_CODES`) and potentially helper functions (e.g., `getCountryInfoByIsoCode(code: string): IntCountryInfo | undefined`, `getDialCode(code: string): string | number | undefined`).
  - _**(Prompt):** What should be the primary key for the `INT_COUNTRY_CODES` Record? The 2-letter ISO code seems standard, similar to `COUNTRY_CODES`. Agree?_
    ///Since the user will primarily be looking up INT countries by dialCode or Country name, the CountryName should be the primary key.
- [ ] **(Next Step):** Integrate lookup logic into AZ report generation/display.
  - _**(Prompt):** Where exactly in the AZ processing/display flow will this country information be used? (e.g., In the worker? In the UI component? In the `AZService`?)_

### 2. AZ Worker Verification

- [ ] **Confirm Worker Instantiation & Execution:** Test the "Generate Reports" button (which triggers `AZService::makeAzCombinedReport`).
  - Does the worker (`az-comparison.worker.ts`) run without errors?
  - Does it successfully receive data, perform the comparison, and post back results (`pricingReport`, `codeReport`, `detailedComparisonData`)?
  - Check browser console for worker logs and any errors during report generation.

### 3. AZ Comparison Logic Review & Refinement

- [ ] **Review `AZService::makeAzCombinedReport`:**
  - _**(Prompt):** Does the current logic (load data -> run worker -> store summaries -> store detailed data -> update store) seem robust and handle potential errors well?_ yes
  - _**(Prompt):** How does this compare to `us.service.ts::processComparisons`? Should we adopt any patterns from the US service?_ i think this should work, if we need to adjust for performace, we wi
- [ ] **Review `az-comparison.worker.ts`:**
  - _**(Prompt):** Is the core comparison logic efficient and accurate? Does it correctly handle edge cases?_ i believe so yes
- [ ] **Review `az_pricing_comparison_db` & `AZDetailedComparisonEntry`:**
  - _**(Prompt):** Is the current schema sufficient? Does the US comparison (`us_pricing_comparison_db`) store detailed results similarly? Should the AZ schema align more closely?_
- [ ] **Review Report UI (`AZPricingReport.vue`, `AZCodeReport.vue`):**
  - _**(Prompt):** How should loading states and errors be handled? Is the detailed comparison display clear?_

### 4. Finalize AZ Cleanup

- [ ] **Implement `AZService::removeTable` Comparison Deletion:**
  - Finalize the logic to delete corresponding comparison table(s) from `az_pricing_comparison_db` when a rate deck table is removed.
  - _**(Prompt - Decision Needed):** When `azfile1` is removed, how to determine comparison table names (e.g., `azfile1_vs_azfile2`, `azfile2_vs_azfile1`) to delete?_
    - _Option A: Check `azStore.filesUploaded` for the other filename._
    - _Option B: Store the generated `detailedComparisonTableName` in `azStore`._
    - _Option C: Query `az_pricing_comparison_db` for table names containing `tableName` (less precise)._
    - _Which approach? (Leaning towards A or B)._ A

## AI Context & Debugging Log (Updated)

- **Focus:** Refactoring AZ to use DexieDB, cleaning up legacy code, preparing for international data integration.
- **Resolution:** Manual AZ uploads fixed. Legacy Dexie service removed. `useLergData.ts` updated to use `LergService` singleton. Created `IntCountryInfo` interface and `INT_COUNTRY_CODES` constant from JSON data.
- **Next:** Integrate `INT_COUNTRY_CODES` lookups into the AZ workflow, then proceed with AZ worker verification and comparison logic refinement.

---

## Build AZ Enhanced Code Report Functionality (New Phase)

**Goal:** Replicate the single-file code summary functionality seen in `USCodeSummary.vue` for A-Z files, providing detailed statistics and country-based coverage analysis. This requires creating a new enhanced report structure, a worker to generate it, and a UI component to display it.

**Context:** We have successfully integrated `INT_COUNTRY_CODES` for looking up international country data. Now, we need to leverage this, along with uploaded A-Z file data, to generate a comprehensive single-file analysis report, similar to the `USEnhancedCodeReport` generated by `us-npa-analyzer.worker.ts`.

### Implementation Phases & Checklist

**Phase 1: Types & Store Foundation**

- [x] **Define Interfaces:** Add `AZEnhancedCodeReport`, `AZFileInfo`, `AZCodeStats`, `AZDestinationStats`, and `AZCountryBreakdown` interfaces to `client/src/types/domains/az-types.ts`.
- [x] **Update Store:** Modify `client/src/stores/az-store.ts` to include state, getters, and actions for `enhancedCodeReports`.

**Phase 2: Worker Implementation**

- [x] **Create Worker File:** Create `client/src/workers/az-analyzer.worker.ts`.
- [x] **Implement Worker Logic:** Add the core logic to the worker to process input data (`fileName`, `fileData`, `intCountryData`) and generate the `AZEnhancedCodeReport`.
- [x] **Worker Input/Output:** Ensure correct message handling for input data and posting the resulting report.

**Phase 3: Service Integration**

- [x] **Update `AZService.ts`:** Modify the file processing function to:
  - Retrieve necessary data (`AZStandardizedData[]`, `INT_COUNTRY_CODES`).
  - Instantiate the `az-analyzer.worker.ts`.
  - Post data to the worker.
  - Listen for the worker's response.
  - Call `azStore.setEnhancedCodeReport` with the received report.

**Phase 4: UI Component Development**

- [x] **Create Component File:** Create `client/src/components/az/AZCodeSummary.vue`.
- [x] **Component Structure:** Set up the `<template>` and `<script setup>` with props (`componentId`).
- [x] **Data Fetching:** Get the `fileName` and `AZEnhancedCodeReport` from the `azStore` based on the `componentId`.
- [x] **Static Rendering:** Render the basic statistics (Total Codes, Code Stats, Destination Stats) using Tailwind CSS.
- [x] **Country Coverage Section (Basic):** Display basic list of countries with search input.
- [x] **Refactor Country Coverage Data:** Update worker (`az-analyzer.worker.ts`), types (`az-types.ts`), and UI (`AzCodeSummary.vue`) to show detailed, expandable destination/dial code breakdown per country.
  - [x] Update `AZCountryBreakdown` interface.
  - [x] Modify worker logic to group by destination name and collect dial codes.
  - [x] Implement expandable UI in `AzCodeSummary.vue`.
- [x] **Search/Filtering:** Add filtering logic for the _refined_ country coverage list.
  - _Learning:_ Initial worker logic used exact dial code matching, missing breakouts with longer codes. Refactored worker to use **longest-prefix matching** against `intCountryData`. Refined UI search to use `startsWith()` for dial code queries to ensure only relevant breakouts are shown.

**Phase 5: Integration & Testing**

- [ ] **Integrate Component:** Add `<AZCodeSummary>` to the appropriate parent component/view.
- [ ] **Testing:** Thoroughly test the entire workflow: file upload -> worker execution -> store update -> UI display, expansion, and filtering.

## Refined Plan for AZCountryBreakdown

Based on user feedback, we need to refine the `AZCountryBreakdown` interface in `az-types.ts` to support an expandable UI that groups dial codes by specific destination names (or "breakouts") within a country, distinguishing between types like fixed and cellular networks.

**Refined Requirements:**

1.  **Structure:** The `AZCountryBreakdown` for each country should contain a list of its breakouts found in the file. Each breakout needs to store its name (e.g., "AFGHANISTAN CELLULAR AREEBA MTN") and the list of unique dial codes associated _specifically_ with that breakout name in the uploaded file.
2.  **Counting:** We need a count of the _unique breakouts_ (destination names) found for the country within the file. The old `coveragePercent` concept is less relevant; the focus is on the number and details of these breakouts.
3.  **Data Source:** The worker (`az-analyzer.worker.ts`) will be responsible for analyzing the `AZStandardizedData[]` and grouping the dial codes by country and then by the exact destination name string found in the rate deck. It will use `INT_COUNTRY_CODES` primarily for mapping dial codes back to the parent country ISO/name.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Update `az-types.ts`:** Modify the `AZCountryBreakdown` interface (and potentially add a new `AZBreakoutDetail` interface) to match these refined requirements.
2.  **Refactor Worker:** Update `az-analyzer.worker.ts` to generate the report according to the new structure, correctly identifying and grouping breakouts and their associated dial codes.
3.  **Update UI:** Adapt `AzCodeSummary.vue` to display the expandable list using the new data structure.

**(Old Prompts Removed)**

## UI Refinement & Data Corrections (Completed)

- **Completed:**
  - Refactored `AZFileUploads.vue` and `AzCodeSummary.vue`:
    - The `AzCodeSummary` now replaces the drop zone view after a file is successfully processed.
    - Removed redundant spacing/borders from `AzCodeSummary` as layout is handled by the parent.
  - Aligned the "Remove" button horizontally with the filename pill inside the `AzCodeSummary` header for better UX.
  - Updated `int-country-codes.ts`: Added entries for "Norfolk Island", "Abkhazia", and specific A.E.T. Antarctica bases (Casey, Davis, Macquarie, Mawson) to ensure correct identification and grouping by the `az-analyzer.worker.ts`.

---

## Dexie Versioning & Comparison Storage Fix (Completed)

- **Completed:**
  - Resolved Dexie schema/versioning conflicts for `az_pricing_comparison_db`.
  - Refactored `az.service.ts::makeAzCombinedReport` to directly manage the fixed `az_comparison_results` table (clearing and bulk-putting data) instead of using the `storeInDexieDB` composable for this specific table.
  - This mirrors the successful pattern used in `us.service.ts` and eliminates the `Dexie SchemaDiff` warnings.

---

## Consolidate AZ Pricing Report (Completed)

**Goal:** Remove the separate expandable summary sections (Sell, Buy, Same, Unmatched) from `AZPricingReport.vue` and modify the `AZDetailedComparisonTable.vue` and its underlying data generation process to display all relevant information (including codes present in only one file) within a single, filterable table.

**Summary of Changes:**

- **Phase 1: Data Structure & Generation (Completed)**

  - Updated `AZDetailedComparisonEntry` interface (`az-types.ts`) to make file-specific fields optional (`rate1?`, `destName1?`, etc.) and added `matchStatus`, `cheaperFile`, `diffPercent`.
  - Refactored `az-comparison.worker.ts` to generate a single list of `AZDetailedComparisonEntry`, populating `matchStatus`, `cheaperFile`, and `diffPercent` correctly for both matched and unmatched codes.
  - Updated `DBSchemas` in `app-types.ts` to include `matchStatus`, `cheaperFile`, and `diffPercent` in the `az_comparison_results` table schema.

- **Phase 2: UI Adaptation (Completed)**

  - Removed the four legacy expandable summary sections from `AZPricingReport.vue` and associated script logic.
  - Enhanced `AZDetailedComparisonTable.vue`:
    - Added a 'Match Status' filter dropdown.
    - Updated table cell rendering (`<td>`) to display 'N/A' for missing optional data.
    - Made 'Rate Comparison' and 'Match Status' filter options dynamic, using actual filenames.
    - Updated 'Match Status' and 'Cheaper File' table columns to display actual filenames (or 'BOTH'/'Same Rate') styled consistently as colored buttons (green/blue/orange/gray).
  - Updated `az.service.ts::getPagedDetailedComparisonData` to include client-side filtering logic for the new `matchStatus` filter.
  - Fixed an import issue in `AZPricingReport.vue` (used `azStore` instead of `appStore`).

- **Phase 3: Testing (User)**
  - Manual testing confirmed filter functionality and display.

**Learnings:**

- The comparison worker needed explicit calculation and population of `cheaperFile` and `diffPercent` fields for the detailed comparison entries.
- UI consistency requires careful mapping of data values (like `matchStatus` or `cheaperFile`) to both filter option text and table cell display text/styling, ensuring filenames are used dynamically where appropriate.

**Current Status:**

- AZ Pricing Report now uses a single, filterable detailed table (`AZDetailedComparisonTable.vue`) for all comparison results (matched and unmatched).
- UI elements (filters, table columns) display dynamic filenames and consistent styling.

**Next Steps:**

- Proceed with remaining tasks from the checklist (e.g., final worker verification, cleanup, international data integration) or address new priorities.

## Implement CSV Download for AZ Detailed Comparison

**Goal:** Add functionality to `AZDetailedComparisonTable.vue` allowing users to download the currently displayed (filtered) comparison data as a CSV file.

**Context:** Users need a way to export the detailed comparison results, respecting the filters they've applied in the UI (Search, Rate Comparison, Match Status).

### Implementation Phases & Checklist

**Phase 1: Service Layer Enhancement**

- [ ] **Create New Service Method:** Add a new method to `AZService.ts` (e.g., `getFilteredDetailedComparisonDataForExport`) that retrieves _all_ matching comparison entries from DexieDB based on the provided filters, without pagination.
  - _**(Prompt):** Should this new service method fetch all data at once, or perhaps iterate through pages in the background to build the full dataset before returning? Fetching all at once might be simpler but could strain memory for very large comparisons. What's the preferred approach?_
  No we only want to export the data that is currently being displyaed in AZDetailedComparisonTable. This will change based on the filters that the user has applied
  - _**(Prompt):** Should the existing `getPagedDetailedComparisonData` be refactored to share filtering logic with the new export method to avoid duplication?_
  see the previous answer, we are only going to export the data that is currently being displayed in the UI

**Phase 2: CSV Generation Logic**

- [ ] **Choose CSV Library/Utility:** Decide on a method for generating the CSV string in the browser.
  - _Option A: A lightweight library like `papaparse` (if not already used)._ we are already using papaparse for uploading, let's stick to that
  - _Option B: Manual CSV string construction (simpler for basic cases, but needs careful escaping)._
  - _**(Prompt):** Do we have a preferred CSV generation library or pattern already established in the project?_
- [ ] **Create Utility Function:** Implement a utility function (e.g., in `client/src/utils/`) that takes the array of `AZDetailedComparisonEntry` objects and converts it into a CSV-formatted string.
  - This function should handle headers (dynamically using `fileName1` and `fileName2` from `azStore`).
  - It needs to format data correctly (e.g., `rate.toFixed(6)`, handling `N/A` or `null` values, formatting `matchStatus` and `cheaperFile` similar to the table display).
  - _**(Prompt):** What should the exact column headers be in the CSV file? Should they match the table headers exactly, including the file names?_ we should match the UI exactly
  - _**(Prompt):** How should `null` or `undefined` values (like `rate1` for `file2_only` entries) be represented in the CSV? Empty string? "N/A"?_ n/a

**Phase 3: UI Integration**

- [ ] **Add Download Button:** Add a "Download Current View as CSV" button to `AZDetailedComparisonTable.vue`, likely near the filter controls.
- [ ] **Implement Click Handler:** Create a function in the component's script that:
  - Gets the current filter values (searchTerm, selectedCheaper, selectedMatchStatus) and the `currentTableName`.
  - Calls the new `AZService` method to fetch all filtered data.
  - Displays a loading indicator while fetching/processing.
  - Calls the CSV utility function to generate the CSV string.
  - Triggers a browser download of the generated CSV string using a dynamically created link.
  - Handles potential errors during fetching or generation.
  - _**(Prompt):** What should the downloaded CSV filename be? e.g., `az-comparison-{tableName}-{timestamp}.csv`?_ just 'az-compare-{timestamp}.csv

**Phase 4: Testing**

- [ ] **Test Download:** Verify that clicking the button downloads a CSV file.
- [ ] **Test Filtering:** Apply various combinations of filters and confirm the downloaded CSV contains only the matching rows.
- [ ] **Test Data Formatting:** Open the CSV and check that headers and data formatting (numbers, statuses, N/A values) are correct.
- [ ] **Test Edge Cases:** Test with empty filter results, large datasets (if possible), and different table names.
