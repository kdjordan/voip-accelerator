# Questions About US Rate Comparison Reports

#### MY CONTEXT FOR YOU.

We are supposed to be generating 2 seperate reports here.

1. Us Code Report.

- This report should show the total number of npanxxs that the 2 files share.
- it should show the the npanxxs that are in file 1 and not in file 2
- it should show the npanxxs that are in file 2 and not in file 1
- it should shwo the precentage of npanxxs that are shared vs unshared.

## File Counts and Processing

1. I see `totalNPANXX: 222392` for file1 and `178364` for file2. Are these numbers correct for your files?
2. Why are we seeing ZERO matches when we have this many records?

## Rate Calculations - File 1

1. File1 shows some rate calculations:
   ```
   "averageInterRate": 0.0657778123223365,
   "averageIntraRate": 0.0651243576207779147,
   "averageIJRate": 0.0651243576207779147
   ```
   But file2 shows all `null`. Why are we calculating rates for file1 but not file2?

## Major Issues I See

1. The code report shows ALL zeros for rate statistics - why aren't we populating `rateStats`?
2. File2's rates are all `null` - are we even accessing file2's data correctly?
3. We have `nonMatchedCodesPercentage: 100` - this suggests we're finding NO matches between files. Is this possible?
4. We're not tracking any NPAs or NXXs (`uniqueNPA: 0`, `uniqueNXX: 0`) - did you want these tracked?

## Questions About Your Data

1. What is the format of the NPANXX codes in each file? Are they exactly the same format?
2. When you look at the same NPANXX in both files manually, do you see it matching?
3. Should we be seeing ANY matches between these files?

## Implementation Questions

1. Should we be using a different field for matching besides NPANXX?
2. Are we reading from the correct IndexedDB tables?
3. Do you want to see the actual records we're comparing to verify the matching logic?

Please answer any of these questions that would help me understand what's wrong with the implementation. I clearly have fundamental misunderstandings about how this comparison should work.
