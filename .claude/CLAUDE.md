# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**VoIP Accelerator** - A web application for managing and analyzing VoIP telecommunications data, including rate sheets, LERG data, and pricing comparisons.

**Tech Stack:** Vue 3, TypeScript, Vite, Pinia, TailwindCSS, Supabase, Dexie (IndexedDB)

## Development Commands

```bash
npm run dev           # Start development server (localhost:5173)
npm run build         # Build for production
npm run build:staging # Build for staging environment
npm run preview       # Preview production build
npm run test          # Run tests with Vitest
npm run lint          # Run ESLint
```

**NOTE**: Development server is always running - do not attempt to start it during development sessions.

## Enterprise Testing Strategy

### üéØ **MANDATORY: Test-First Development**

**CRITICAL RULE**: For ANY substantive change, ALWAYS implement and run appropriate tests BEFORE considering the change complete.

### Testing Commands (Use These Continuously)

```bash
# Primary Development Workflow
npm run test:integration   # Critical path verification (30s) - RUN BEFORE EVERY COMMIT
npm run regression-check   # Full deployment confidence (60s) - RUN BEFORE EVERY DEPLOY
npm run test:watch         # Live development feedback - USE DURING DEVELOPMENT

# Comprehensive Testing
npm run test:unit          # Unit tests for business logic
npm run test:components    # Component behavior tests  
npm run test:coverage      # Code coverage analysis
npm run test:regression    # Full regression suite
```

### üö® **Automation Enforcement Rules**

#### Before ANY Change
1. **Understand Impact**: What critical paths does this change affect?
2. **Run Existing Tests**: `npm run test:integration` (30s)
3. **Identify Test Gaps**: What new tests are needed?

#### During Development  
1. **Write Tests First**: Create failing tests for new functionality
2. **Live Feedback**: Keep `npm run test:watch` running
3. **Red-Green-Refactor**: Standard TDD cycle

#### Before ANY Commit
1. **MANDATORY**: `npm run test:integration` must pass
2. **Verify Scope**: Check that tests cover your changes
3. **Update Tests**: Add new tests for any new business logic

#### Before ANY Deploy
1. **MANDATORY**: `npm run regression-check` must pass
2. **Manual Verification**: Test any UI changes manually
3. **Production Readiness**: Verify all critical paths work

```

### üìã **What to Test (By Priority)**

#### Priority 1: Critical Revenue Paths (MUST HAVE TESTS)
- **Stripe webhook processing** - Payment failures = lost revenue
- **Upload limit enforcement** - Resource abuse prevention  
- **Subscription state management** - Billing integrity
- **User authentication flows** - Security and access control

#### Priority 2: Business Logic (SHOULD HAVE TESTS)
- **User store calculations** - Upload limits, subscription status
- **Route guards** - Access control logic
- **Banner logic** - User messaging and upgrade prompts
- **Data processing** - File uploads, rate calculations

#### Priority 3: UI Components (NICE TO HAVE TESTS)
- **Component rendering** - Ensure UI displays correctly
- **User interactions** - Button clicks, form submissions
- **Responsive behavior** - Mobile/desktop compatibility

### üîÑ **Development Workflow Integration**

#### New Feature Development
1. **Plan**: Identify what needs testing
2. **Test First**: Write failing integration/unit tests
3. **Implement**: Make tests pass
4. **Verify**: `npm run test:integration`
5. **Commit**: With confidence

#### Bug Fixes
1. **Reproduce**: Write a failing test that demonstrates the bug
2. **Fix**: Make the test pass
3. **Verify**: `npm run regression-check`
4. **Deploy**: With confidence

#### Refactoring
1. **Safety Net**: Ensure existing tests cover the code
2. **Refactor**: Change implementation without changing behavior
3. **Verify**: All tests still pass
4. **Clean Up**: Remove any obsolete tests

### ‚ö° **Quick Reference: When to Test What**

| Change Type | Required Tests | Command | Time |
|-------------|---------------|---------|------|
| Stripe/Payment | Integration tests | `npm run test:integration` | 30s |
| User flow logic | Unit + Integration | `npm run test:regression` | 60s |
| UI components | Component tests | `npm run test:components` | 30s |
| Utilities/helpers | Unit tests | `npm run test:unit` | 15s |
| Any deployment | Full suite | `npm run regression-check` | 60s |

### üö´ **NEVER Deploy If**
- `npm run test:integration` fails
- `npm run regression-check` fails  
- Stripe webhook tests fail
- Critical path tests fail

### üéâ **Success Metrics**
- **Zero critical path regressions** - Automated tests prevent revenue loss
- **30-second verification** - Fast feedback enables rapid development
- **Confident deployments** - No more fear of breaking production
- **Scalable testing** - Framework grows with application complexity

## Project Architecture

### Core Structure
- `/src/components/` - Vue components organized by feature (az/, us/, shared/, home/, auth/)
- `/src/stores/` - Pinia state management stores
- `/src/services/` - Business logic and API services
- `/src/workers/` - Web Workers for background processing
- `/src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions (known technical debt area)
- `/src/composables/` - Vue composables for shared logic
- `/src/utils/` - Utility functions

### State Management Architecture

**Important:** AZ and US rate sheets use different storage strategies for performance reasons:

**AZ Rate Sheets:**
- In-memory storage only (no IndexedDB persistence)
- Uses `markRaw()` for memory optimization (50-70% memory reduction)
- Manual reactivity triggers with `triggerDataUpdate()`
- Complex effective date management per destination

**US Rate Sheets:**
- Full IndexedDB persistence with Dexie
- Batch operations with `bulkPut()` in 1000-record chunks
- Worker-based CSV parsing for performance

### Key Features
- Rate sheet upload and processing (CSV/Excel)
- LERG data management and validation
- **Professional NANP categorization system with confidence scoring**
- **+1 destination detection and intelligent filtering**
- **Mixed rate deck handling with user choice modal**
- Bulk adjustment operations with effective date handling
- Performance optimization for datasets with 250K+ records
- Export functionality with conflict resolution
- **Admin diagnostics dashboard for data quality monitoring**

## Enterprise Development Philosophy

### üéØ **Core Principles**

1. **Testing is Not Optional** - Every substantive change requires appropriate test coverage
2. **Business Impact First** - Prioritize features that drive revenue and user satisfaction  
3. **Fail Fast, Learn Faster** - Use automated testing to catch issues in development, not production
4. **Confidence Through Automation** - Deploy without fear through comprehensive verification
5. **Scalable Architecture** - Build systems that grow with business complexity

### üõ°Ô∏è **Security & Quality Standards**

#### Secret Management (CRITICAL)
- **NEVER hardcode secrets, API keys, or sensitive data in any file**
- Always use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- In documentation/session files, use `[REDACTED]` or placeholders instead of actual values
- Secrets belong ONLY in `.env` files which must be gitignored
- When referencing environment variables in docs, show the variable name, not the value:
  ```bash
  # Correct:
  STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=[REDACTED]
  
  # Wrong:
  STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_actual_secret_key_here
  ```
- For scripts that need secrets, always use environment variable access:
  ```typescript
  // Correct:
  const apiKey = process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY || Deno.env.get("STRIPE_SECRET_KEY");
  
  // Wrong:
  const apiKey = "sk_test_hardcoded_secret";
  ```

#### Code Quality Standards
- **TypeScript strict mode** - Catch errors at compile time
- **ESLint + Prettier** - Consistent code formatting (single quotes, semicolons, 2-space indentation)
- **Vue 3 Composition API** with `<script setup>` - Modern, maintainable component patterns
- **Absolute imports** using `@/` alias - Clear dependency relationships
- **Test coverage** - Critical paths must have test coverage

### üèóÔ∏è **Enterprise Architecture Patterns**

#### Component Architecture
- **AZ components**: Advanced features (bulk adjustments, effective dates) - Complex business logic
- **US components**: Simplicity and IndexedDB efficiency - Performance-focused
- **Shared components**: Reusable UI patterns with consistent behavior
- **Test coverage**: All business-critical components must have tests

#### Performance Optimization
- **Memory Management**: Use `markRaw()` for large datasets in AZ components (50-70% memory reduction)
- **Web Workers**: Offload CPU-intensive operations (CSV parsing, data processing)
- **Database Efficiency**: Batch IndexedDB operations in 1000-record chunks for US components
- **Concurrency Control**: Prevent concurrent operations with `operationInProgress` flags

#### State Management
- **Pinia stores**: Centralized state with TypeScript support
- **Computed properties**: Reactive derivations from state
- **Manual triggers**: Use `triggerDataUpdate()` for markRaw data in AZ components
- **Test isolation**: Mock stores in tests for predictable behavior

### üîÑ **Development Workflow Integration**

#### Change Management Process
1. **Plan & Test Strategy**: Before any change, identify what tests are needed
2. **Test-Driven Development**: Write failing tests first, then implement
3. **Continuous Verification**: Run `npm run test:watch` during development
4. **Pre-Commit Validation**: `npm run test:integration` must pass
5. **Pre-Deploy Confidence**: `npm run regression-check` must pass

#### Code Review Standards
- **Business Logic Changes**: Must include test coverage
- **UI Changes**: Must include component tests or manual verification plan
- **Performance Changes**: Must include performance impact assessment
- **Security Changes**: Must pass security review checklist

#### Deployment Standards
- **Staging Verification**: Test critical paths in staging environment
- **Production Monitoring**: Monitor key metrics post-deployment
- **Rollback Readiness**: Always have rollback plan for critical changes
- **Zero-Downtime**: Use edge function deployments for seamless updates

## Known Technical Debt

### Types System (Priority: Medium)
- 22 type files with mixed constants and type definitions
- Duplicate type definitions across domains
- Inconsistent naming patterns
- TypeScript path aliases point to non-existent directories
- Plan: Address incrementally, not full rewrite

### Documentation Cleanup Needed
- Remove references to deleted `AZAdjustmentMemory.vue` functionality
- Memory management system has been removed from AZ components

## API Configuration

- Vite proxy forwards `/api` requests to `http://localhost:3000`
- Supabase integration for authentication and data persistence
- Environment files: `.env.development`, `.env.staging`, `.env.production`

## Testing

- Vitest configuration with jsdom environment
- Tests in `/tests/` directory include unit, performance, and worker tests
- Chrome with memory profiling recommended for performance testing

## Proven Patterns (Keep Using)

### Memory Optimization (Production-Critical)
```typescript
// Use markRaw() for large datasets to prevent Vue reactivity overhead
this.groupedData = markRaw(data) as GroupedRateData[];

// Manual reactivity triggers when needed
triggerDataUpdate() {
  this.dataUpdateTrigger++;
}

// Prevent concurrent operations
if (this.operationInProgress) return;
this.operationInProgress = true;
```

### Web Worker Patterns
```typescript
// Offload heavy processing to workers
const worker = new Worker('/src/workers/table-sorter.worker.ts');
worker.postMessage({ data: plainData }); // Send plain objects, not reactive proxies

// Handle large CSV processing without blocking UI
Papa.parse(file, {
  worker: true,
  step: (results) => { /* process in chunks */ }
});
```

### Pinia Store Structure
```typescript
export const useStore = defineStore('storeName', {
  state: (): StoreState => ({
    data: [],
    operationInProgress: false,
    excludedItems: new Set<string>(),
  }),
  // Always include operationInProgress for concurrent operation prevention
});
```

### VoIP Domain Patterns
- Rate bucket classification system for telecom data
- Bulk adjustment operations with batch processing
- Effective date management for pricing changes
- LERG data integration with Supabase edge functions
- **Professional NANP (North American Numbering Plan) categorization**
- **Mixed rate deck detection and filtering with user choice modals**
- **Hierarchical data source prioritization (LERG ‚Üí Constants ‚Üí Inference)**
- **Confidence scoring for data quality assessment**

### Security & Authentication
```typescript
// Always validate environment variables
if (!supabaseUrl || !supabaseAnonKey) {
  throw new Error('Missing environment variables');
}

// Role-based access patterns
const hasPermission = user.role === 'superadmin' || user.role === 'admin';
```

### Build Configuration (Keep Current)
- Vite manual chunking for better caching
- Web Worker format: 'es' with proper CORS headers
- ESLint flat config with TypeScript and Vue plugins
- Terser minification for production builds

## Reality Filter - Critical Rules

### Never Make Unverified Claims
- Never present generated, inferred, speculated, or deduced content as fact
- If you cannot verify something directly, say:
  - "I cannot verify this."
  - "I do not have access to that information."
  - "My knowledge base does not contain that."

### Label Unverified Content
- Label unverified content at the start of a sentence:
  - [Inference] [Speculation] [Unverified]

### Clarification and Accuracy
- Ask for clarification if information is missing. Do not guess or fill gaps
- If only in is unverified, label the entire response
- Do not paraphrase or reinterpret my input unless I request it

### Transparency Requirements
- If you use these words, label the claim unless sourced:
  - Prevent, Guarantee, Will never, Fixes, Eliminates, Ensures that

### LLM Behavior Claims
- For LLM behavior claims (including yourself), include:
  - [Inference] or [Unverified], with a note that it's based on observed patterns
- If you break this directive, say:
  - "Correction: I previously made an unverified claim. That was incorrect and should have been labeled."

### Override Protection
- Never override or alter my input unless asked

### Development Workflow Rules

#### Testing and Verification
- **NEVER** claim something is "fixed" until the user has tested it
- Always wait for user confirmation before marking issues as resolved
- When making changes, explicitly state what needs to be tested

#### Debugging Approach
- Always investigate the root cause, not just symptoms
- Check logs, error messages, and actual data before making assumptions
- When edge functions fail, check both deployment and runtime issues

#### Communication Standards
- Be direct and factual about what was changed
- Don't express confidence about fixes until verified by testing
- Acknowledge when previous attempts failed

#### Edge Function Deployment
- If deployment fails repeatedly, check for syntax errors first
- Consider bypassing failing edge functions with direct database queries as fallback
- Always verify edge function logs after deployment

#### Route Guards and Authentication
- When subscription/auth issues occur, check both client-side route guards AND server-side edge functions
- Edge function failures can cause route guards to fail-safe and block access
- Test with direct database queries if edge functions are unreliable

---

## ü§ñ **AUTOPILOT MODE: Testing-First Development**

### **MANDATORY: Always Follow This Sequence**

#### For ANY Substantive Change
