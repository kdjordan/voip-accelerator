## Progress

### 08:49 - Session Started
- Created session file
- Ready for development tasks

### 09:00 - Stripe Sync Engine Implementation
**Decision**: Implement Stripe Sync Engine now (pre-launch) instead of later to avoid risky migration with active users

**Completed**:
- ✅ Installed @supabase/stripe-sync-engine package
- ✅ Created comprehensive Stripe schema with all necessary tables (customers, subscriptions, products, prices, invoices, etc.)
- ✅ Applied migrations to staging database successfully
- ✅ Created helper view `stripe.user_subscriptions` for easy tier queries
- ✅ Added helper functions: `stripe.get_user_tier()` and `stripe.is_subscription_active()`
- ✅ Created new webhook handler at `stripe-sync/index.ts` that syncs all Stripe events to database

**Benefits gained**:
- Eliminated need for custom subscription tracking in profiles table
- Direct SQL queries for tier checks (no API calls)
- Automatic sync of all Stripe data
- Better foundation for upload tracking and session management
- No risk of migration issues later with active users~

**Next steps**:
- Deploy the new webhook handler
- Update application to query Stripe tables instead of profiles.subscription_tier
- Implement upload tracking using Stripe data
- Remove old webhook handler once confirmed working

### Update - 2025-08-12 10:16 AM

**Summary**: Implemented Stripe Sync Engine infrastructure to replace custom subscription tracking

**Git Changes**:
- Modified: package.json, package-lock.json (added @supabase/stripe-sync-engine)
- Added: supabase/functions/stripe-sync/index.ts (new webhook handler)
- Added: supabase/migrations/20250812_stripe_sync_engine.sql (Stripe schema)
- Current branch: dev (commit: abd3322)

**Todo Progress**: 6 completed, 0 in progress, 4 pending
- ✓ Completed: Review current implementation status
- ✓ Completed: Analyze Supabase Stripe Engine for potential integration
- ✓ Completed: Check current Stripe products and pricing setup
- ✓ Completed: Install and configure Stripe Sync Engine
- ✓ Completed: Run Stripe Sync Engine schema migrations
- ✓ Completed: Create improved webhook handler with Stripe data syncing

**Details**: 
Made strategic decision to implement Stripe Sync Engine before launch while we have zero users, avoiding risky migration later. Created comprehensive Stripe schema in database with all necessary tables (customers, subscriptions, products, prices, invoices). Successfully applied migrations to staging environment. The new architecture eliminates custom subscription tracking in profiles table, provides direct SQL access to billing data for instant tier checks, and creates a solid foundation for upload limits and session management features.

**Key Achievement**: Infrastructure ready for simplified billing queries - can now check user tiers with `SELECT * FROM stripe.user_subscriptions WHERE email = ?` instead of API calls.

1. **Enhanced PaymentModal Component**:
   - Added `preselectedTier` prop to respect user's chosen tier
   - Conditional rendering: shows tier selection OR pre-selected tier based on user state
   - Updated messaging to "Complete Your [Tier] Subscription" vs "Choose Your Plan"
   - Integrated with user store to get trial_tier/subscription_tier

2. **Updated Edge Functions**:
   - Deployed `set-trial-tier`: Applies selected tier during signup process
   - Updated `track-upload`: Fixed tier names (accelerator/optimizer/enterprise)
   - Deployed `manage-session`: Enforces single/multi-session rules by tier

3. **Created Upload Tracking System**:
   - Built `useUploadTracking` composable for frontend integration
   - Accelerator tier: 100 uploads/month with monthly reset
   - Optimizer/Enterprise: Unlimited uploads
   - Ready for integration into upload components

4. **Session Management Infrastructure**:
   - Created `active_sessions` table migration
   - Enterprise users: Multiple concurrent sessions allowed
   - Accelerator/Optimizer: Single session enforcement
   - Automatic stale session cleanup function

**Code Architecture Changes**:
- PaymentModal now computes user tier from store state
- Dashboard passes preselected tier to modal
- Upload tracking composable provides tier-aware upload limits
- Session management edge function enforces tier-based rules

**Production Readiness Status**:
✅ Three-tier pricing system complete with proper UX flow
✅ Edge functions deployed and updated
✅ Frontend components respect user's tier choice
✅ Upload limits and session management infrastructure ready

**Next Testing Requirements**:
- End-to-end flow: signup → tier selection → trial → payment
- Verify PaymentModal shows correct tier when trial expires
- Test upload limit enforcement for Accelerator users
- Validate session management for different tiers

The system now maintains user tier consistency from signup through payment, eliminating the confusing re-selection of plans that was identified in the user's screenshots.
