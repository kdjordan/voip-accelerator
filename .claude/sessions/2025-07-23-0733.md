### Update - 2025-07-23 07:50 AM

**Summary**: Disabled Google Sign-in functionality to prevent random account signups

**Git Changes**:
- No uncommitted changes (all changes from previous update were committed)
- Current branch: dev (commit: 861829a)

**Todo Progress**: 3 completed, 0 in progress, 0 pending
- ✓ Completed: Comment out Google Sign-in button in HomeView.vue
- ✓ Completed: Comment out Google Sign-up button and divider in SignUpForm.vue

### Update - 2025-07-23 04:38 PM

**Summary**: Enhanced CSV export system and UI improvements for rate sheet and comparison exports

**Git Changes**:
- Modified: client/src/components/exports/USExportFilters.vue, client/src/components/exports/USExportFormatOptions.vue, client/src/components/exports/USExportModal.vue, client/src/composables/exports/useCSVExport.ts, client/src/pages/DashBoard.vue
- Current branch: dev (commit: 098ab95)

**Todo Progress**: 1 completed, 0 in progress, 0 pending
- ✓ Completed: Move Session History section from format options to Active Filters for rate-sheet exports

**Issues Encountered**:
- Missing headers in CSV exports for rate sheets
- Column header format inconsistency in comparison exports 
- Export modal styling inconsistencies between comparison and rate-sheet exports
- TypeScript compilation error due to missing semicolon

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Fixed CSV header export by ensuring headers are included in Papa Parse data structure
- Updated comparison export headers from "filename RATE_TYPE" to "RATE_TYPE - filename" format
- Unified export modal styling with consistent typography (text-lg font-semibold for section headers)
- Restructured format options from separate bento boxes to unified layout with Countries section separate
- Moved session history controls from format options to Active Filters section for better UX
- Fixed filtered data warning to appear alongside (not replace) record count information
- Resolved TypeScript errors in export components
- Removed deprecated "No database tables found" bento component from DashBoard.vue for cleaner UI

**Code Changes Made**:
- Enhanced useCSVExport.ts with proper header inclusion and context-aware export functions
- Updated USExportModal.vue with consistent header styling and conditional rendering
- Reorganized USExportFormatOptions.vue with improved bento box layout
- Modified USExportFilters.vue to include session history for rate-sheet exports
- Improved warning message placement in Countries section for better user feedback
- Cleaned up DashBoard.vue by removing "No database tables found" bento component and all associated variables, functions, and UI elements

**Details**: Comprehensive enhancement of the CSV export system focusing on header consistency, UI/UX improvements, and proper data formatting. The export modal now provides a unified experience across both comparison and rate-sheet exports while maintaining functional differences where appropriate.

### Update - 2025-07-23 08:40 PM

**Summary**: Major DashBoard.vue redesign with consistent bento pattern and streamlined UI

**Git Changes**:
- Modified: client/src/pages/DashBoard.vue
- Current branch: dev (commit: TBD)

**Todo Progress**: 6 completed, 0 in progress, 0 pending
- ✓ Completed: Reorganize dashboard to use consistent bento pattern
- ✓ Completed: Extract stats cards as separate top-level bentos
- ✓ Completed: Implement progressive disclosure for email update section
- ✓ Completed: Move all action buttons to left column for consistency
- ✓ Completed: Move Edit button inline with Email label as pencil icon
- ✓ Completed: Consolidate Change Plan and Manage Billing into single action

**Issues Addressed**:
- Inconsistent bento design pattern (nested sub-bentos only in welcome section)
- Wasteful screen real estate with always-visible email update form
- Random placement of action buttons without logical grouping
- Visual clutter from unnecessary icons in stats cards
- Duplicate functionality between Change Plan and Manage Billing actions

**Solutions Implemented**:
- **Consistent bento pattern**: Separated welcome section from stats, making each element a top-level bento
- **Progressive disclosure**: Email update form only appears when Edit is clicked, with keyboard shortcuts (Enter/Escape)
- **Left-aligned action pattern**: All interactive elements (Edit, Manage Billing) positioned consistently on left side
- **Streamlined visual design**: Removed decorative icons from stats cards for cleaner appearance
- **Inline pencil icons**: Replaced text buttons with subtle pencil icons next to their respective labels
- **Consolidated billing actions**: Single "Manage Billing" action (opens Stripe portal) instead of separate Change Plan + Manage Billing
- **Logical information hierarchy**: Reordered fields to Next Billing Date → Current Plan → Email → Price
- **Enhanced badge styling**: Current Plan badge uses blue "info" variant and small size for better visual hierarchy

**UI/UX Improvements**:
- **Space efficiency**: Eliminated wasted vertical space from always-visible forms and redundant sections
- **Visual consistency**: All bentos follow same styling pattern without random nesting
- **Clear affordances**: Pencil icons provide clear "editable" signaling without visual noise
- **Reduced cognitive load**: Fewer decisions for users (one billing action vs two separate actions)
- **Better responsive layout**: Stats cards display cleanly on mobile and desktop

**Code Architecture**:
- Removed unused component imports (AccountBillingCard, ProfileSettingsCard)
- Consolidated functionality directly in DashBoard.vue with proper reactive state management
- Maintained existing business logic while improving presentation layer
- Added proper keyboard interaction patterns (Enter to save, Escape to cancel)

**Details**: Complete redesign of the dashboard following senior UI/UX principles. The new design eliminates inconsistent patterns, reduces visual clutter, and creates a more intuitive user experience through progressive disclosure and consistent action placement. All functionality is preserved while significantly improving usability and visual hierarchy.
