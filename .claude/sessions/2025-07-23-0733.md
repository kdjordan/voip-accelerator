**Git Changes**:
- No uncommitted changes (all changes from previous update were committed)
- Current branch: dev (commit: 861829a)

**Todo Progress**: 3 completed, 0 in progress, 0 pending
- ✓ Completed: Comment out Google Sign-in button in HomeView.vue
- ✓ Completed: Comment out Google Sign-up button and divider in SignUpForm.vue
- ✓ Completed: Comment out Google Sign-in button and divider in SignInForm.vue

**Issues Encountered**:
- Missing headers in CSV exports for rate sheets
- Column header format inconsistency in comparison exports 
- Export modal styling inconsistencies between comparison and rate-sheet exports
- TypeScript compilation error due to missing semicolon

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Fixed CSV header export by ensuring headers are included in Papa Parse data structure
- Updated comparison export headers from "filename RATE_TYPE" to "RATE_TYPE - filename" format
- Unified export modal styling with consistent typography (text-lg font-semibold for section headers)
- Restructured format options from separate bento boxes to unified layout with Countries section separate
- Moved session history controls from format options to Active Filters section for better UX
- Fixed filtered data warning to appear alongside (not replace) record count information
- Resolved TypeScript errors in export components
- Removed deprecated "No database tables found" bento component from DashBoard.vue for cleaner UI

**Code Changes Made**:
- Enhanced useCSVExport.ts with proper header inclusion and context-aware export functions
- Updated USExportModal.vue with consistent header styling and conditional rendering
- Reorganized USExportFormatOptions.vue with improved bento box layout
- Modified USExportFilters.vue to include session history for rate-sheet exports
- Improved warning message placement in Countries section for better user feedback
- Cleaned up DashBoard.vue by removing "No database tables found" bento component and all associated variables, functions, and UI elements

**Details**: Comprehensive enhancement of the CSV export system focusing on header consistency, UI/UX improvements, and proper data formatting. The export modal now provides a unified experience across both comparison and rate-sheet exports while maintaining functional differences where appropriate.
