**Todo Progress**: 2 completed, 0 in progress, 0 pending

**Major Achievements**:

1. **Modal System Cleanup**: 
   - Removed UploadLimitFullscreen blocking modal from 8 pages/components
   - Enhanced ServiceExpiryBanner to handle multiple expiry scenarios with props
   - Eliminated page-blocking logic that was creating "total nightmare" UX

2. **Two-Path Signup Flow**:
   - Implemented "Start 7-Day Free Trial" vs "Subscribe Immediately" paths
   - All trials default to Optimizer tier (prevents abuse)
   - Added proper bento box styling to match app design
   - Used Heroicons BoltIcon for consistency

3. **Technical Fixes**:
   - Fixed recursive update errors in SignUpPage by using computed property
   - Improved responsive layout with proper grid breakpoints
   - Made pricing cards compact and readable

**Issues Encountered & Solutions**:
- **Recursive Update Errors**: Fixed by replacing direct reactive access with computed property
- **Layout Issues**: Terrible mobile layout fixed with proper grid/flexbox and bento container
- **Modal Consistency**: Replaced custom SVG with Heroicons for consistency

**Code Architecture Improvements**:
- Enhanced ServiceExpiryBanner with intelligent auto-generation based on reason prop
- Eliminated fullscreen page blocking in favor of banner notifications
- Two-step signup flow with tier selection → account creation
- Proper TypeScript emit signatures for trial vs paid signup paths

**User Experience Impact**:
- Eliminated modal chaos that was blocking users
- Clear, focused signup paths preventing decision paralysis
- Professional bento box design matching app aesthetic
- Half-width centered trial selection for better focus

**Next Steps**:
- Test end-to-end signup flow (trial and paid paths)
- Verify Stripe integration works with new tier selection
- Test upload limit detection with ServiceExpiryBanner
- Consider route guard implementation for subscription enforcement
