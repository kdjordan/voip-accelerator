### Agent 1 Contributions

#### Initial Analysis (08:04 AM)
- ✅ Ran integration test suite - all 26 tests passing
- ✅ Reviewed previous session (2025-08-21-1440.md) findings:
  - Subscription cancellation system complete
  - Paid signup flow complete
  - Outstanding: Some test coverage for cancellation flow
- ✅ Checked documentation for forgotten requirements
- ✅ Found comprehensive Enterprise plan specification in PRICING_TIERS_IMPLEMENTATION.md

#### Enterprise Plan Current Status
**Database Infrastructure**: Partially implemented
- Organizations table created with seat management
- Active sessions table for multi-user tracking
- Organization invitations system
- RLS policies for team access control

**Frontend Components**: Basic UI exists
- TierSelectionStep.vue documented but needs implementation
- Basic Enterprise tier shown in billing modals
- Organization dashboard components not yet built

**Missing Enterprise Features**:
1. Multi-user session management
2. Team invitation workflow
3. Seat usage tracking and enforcement
4. Organization admin dashboard
5. Team member management UI
6. Billing tied to organization (not individual)
7. Edge functions for team operations

#### Session Management & Enterprise Implementation Plan (08:30 AM)

**Clarified Requirements**:
- ALL users (regardless of plan) limited to single active session
- Enterprise admin is the billing contact and seat manager
- Enterprise seats are individual email accounts (5 total)
- No billing migration needed (no existing users)

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement universal session management for all users
- [ ] Create session check on login
- [ ] Add force logout functionality
- [ ] Build Enterprise organization creation on signup
- [ ] Create team invitation system
- [ ] Build admin dashboard for seat management
- [ ] Implement invite acceptance flow
- [ ] Add seat limit enforcement

**Session Management Approach**:
1. On login: Check active_sessions table for existing session
2. If exists on different device: Show conflict modal with force logout option
3. No heartbeat needed - simpler approach
4. Enterprise users still single session, but organization can have 5 different users

### Agent 2 Contributions



### Enterprise Plan Q and A
6. Organization Creation: Should Enterprise accounts automatically create an organization on signup, or is this a separate step after
  payment?
  // The user that signs up for the enterprise plan will be the one responsible for billing, and the one responsible for managing their seats, which are just individual accounts. So we need to make sure that we have the ability to trigger an invite from Superbase based on the organization and the number of seats remaining to an email address that is provided by this admin. So the admin role will only be used by enterprise plan and will only be assigned to the person who signs up for the enterprise plan.
  7. Seat Counting: Does "5 seats" mean:
    - 5 total user accounts can exist?
    - 5 users can be actively logged in simultaneously?
    - 5 users total but only some can be active at once?
    Yes, five seats means five individual email accounts associated with that organization that can freely login and access the system with unlimited usage
  8. Billing Migration: For existing users upgrading to Enterprise, how do we handle the transition from individual to organization
  billing?
  We have no active users so we're setting on this app and testing it before we go live
