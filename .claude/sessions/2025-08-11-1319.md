# Development Session: 2025-08-11-1319

## Session Overview
**Start Time:** January 11, 2025 at 1:19 PM

## Goals
- Fix subscription check errors (500 status) preventing trial user access
- Debug edge function failures for user 9a83b70e-0dd9-4f95-9b84-c58ec968bf50
- Ensure trial plan users can access the application properly
- Continue implementation from IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_SESSION_MANAGEMENT.md

## Progress

### Issue Identified
- Edge function `check-subscription-status` has a bug: `now` variable referenced before declaration (line 58 uses it, but it's defined on line 62)
- This causes the 500 errors shown in the console
- Router already bypasses the edge function and uses direct database queries
- The error is occurring in Dashboard initialization, likely from LERG loading

### Fix Applied
- Fixed the edge function code by moving `const now = new Date()` before the console.log statement
- Edge function deployment requires elevated permissions (getting 403 errors)

### Workaround
Since the router already uses direct database queries, the app should still work for the trial user. The edge function errors are non-critical as they're only used for informational purposes in the billing composable.

### Resolution âœ…
- Successfully deployed the fixed `check-subscription-status` edge function to staging (odnwqnmgftgjrdkotlro)
- The function now properly declares the `now` variable before using it
- User profile verified: Trial subscription valid until 2025-08-17
- Edge function deployment successful at 69.02kB size

### Next Steps
- Test the application to verify 500 errors are resolved
- User should now have full access with their trial subscription (expires Aug 17, 2025)

## Second Issue Fixed: Infinite Recursion & RLS Policy

### Problems Found:
1. **Infinite recursion**: UserStore was signing out users on profile fetch failure, which triggered auth state change, causing another profile fetch attempt
2. **RLS Policy conflict**: The `profiles_select_policy` was too complex and failing for users without an organization_id

### Solutions Applied:
1. **Removed auto-signout**: Commented out the code that signs users out on profile fetch failure to prevent infinite loop
2. **Simplified RLS policies**: 
   - Dropped complex `profiles_select_policy`
   - Created simple `users_can_read_own_profile` policy (auth.uid() = id)
   - Updated update policy to `users_can_update_own_profile`

### Current Status:
- User profile verified in database: Trial active until Aug 17, 2025
- RLS policies fixed to allow users to read their own profile
- Infinite recursion loop broken

## Third Task: Three-Tier Pricing Structure Implementation

### Pricing Tiers Design

### Problems Found:
1. **Infinite recursion**: UserStore was signing out users on profile fetch failure, which triggered auth state change, causing another profile fetch attempt
2. **RLS Policy conflict**: The `profiles_select_policy` was too complex and failing for users without an organization_id

### Solutions Applied:
1. **Removed auto-signout**: Commented out the code that signs users out on profile fetch failure to prevent infinite loop
2. **Simplified RLS policies**: 
   - Dropped complex `profiles_select_policy`
   - Created simple `users_can_read_own_profile` policy (auth.uid() = id)
   - Updated update policy to `users_can_update_own_profile`

### Current Status:
- User profile verified in database: Trial active until Aug 17, 2025
- RLS policies fixed to allow users to read their own profile
- Infinite recursion loop broken
