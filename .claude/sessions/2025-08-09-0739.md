**Todo Progress**: 6 completed, 0 in progress, 0 pending
- âœ“ Completed: Verify git remote configuration
- âœ“ Completed: Search for 'factor-pricing' references in the codebase
- âœ“ Completed: Update package.json files with new project name
- âœ“ Completed: Update any configuration files
- âœ“ Completed: Update UI text and branding references
- âœ“ Completed: Check and update environment files if needed

**Details**: 
- Successfully updated all references from "Factor Pricing" to "VOIP Accelerator" throughout the codebase
- Updated package.json files (client and root) with new project name
- Updated all HTML meta tags and social media cards
- Fixed privacy policy and terms pages with new branding
- Updated README and Supabase function documentation
- Fixed production environment file (removed duplicate entries)
- Added both www and non-www versions of voipaccelerator.com to CORS configuration
- Deployed updated edge functions to staging environment
- Replaced personal email (k.dean.jordan@gmail.com) with admin@voipaccelerator.com in all files
- Deleted Factor Pricing app from AWS Amplify
- Verified Supabase projects already correctly named (voip-accelerator-prod and voip-accelerator-staging)

**Issues Encountered**:
- Docker Desktop was not running initially, preventing edge function deployment
- Hello-world edge function failed to deploy due to missing deno.json file (non-critical)

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Started Docker Desktop to enable edge function deployment
- Successfully deployed all critical edge functions to staging
- Postponed production deployment until other work is complete

**Next Steps**:
- Update Supabase dashboard authentication settings for staging
- Configure Site URL and Redirect URLs in Supabase
- Update any customized email templates
- Continue with staging environment development before production deployment

### Update - 2025-08-09 08:30 AM

**Summary**: Configured Stripe MCP and identified next steps for Stripe account migration

**Git Changes**:
- No changes (working tree clean)
- Current branch: dev-rate-gen (commit: 3d304c1)

**Progress on Stripe Configuration**:
- âœ… Configured Claude Desktop MCP with STRIPE_API_KEY environment variable

- Ready to update Stripe environment variables in all .env files

**Immediate Next Steps**:
1. Get new Stripe API keys from VOIP Accelerator Stripe account
2. Update all .env files (development, staging, production) with new keys
3. Create/verify Stripe products and pricing for VOIP Accelerator
4. Update Supabase dashboard authentication settings
5. Test staging environment with new configuration

**Current Priority**: Update Stripe environment variables across all environments

**Summary**: Successfully tested Stripe MCP integration functionality

**Stripe MCP Testing Results**:
âœ… **Basic Connection** - Retrieved account balance (test mode, $0.00 USD available)  
âœ… **Customer Management** - Listed existing customers (found 1 customer: cus_SgJDVcnoHILPq8)
ðŸ”„ **Additional Features** - Ready to test products, pricing, payment links, and invoices

**Current Status**: 
- Stripe MCP is fully functional and connected to correct account
- Basic operations confirmed working
- Ready to proceed with comprehensive Stripe operations testing

**Next Steps**:
1. Test product and pricing functionality  
2. Test payment links creation

## SESSION END - 2025-08-09 10:25 AM

### Session Summary
**Duration:** ~2.5 hours (07:39 - 10:25)  
**Branch:** dev  
**Focus:** Stripe MCP Integration & Security Audit

### Git Summary
- **Files Modified:** 1 (client/.env.development - Stripe keys updated)
- **Commits Made:** 0 (working tree clean at session end)
- **Final Status:** Clean working directory

### Todo Summary (5/5 Completed)
**âœ… All Tasks Completed:**
1. âœ… Search for Stripe API keys in code files
2. âœ… Search for Supabase keys in code files  
3. âœ… Check for other API keys and secrets
4. âœ… Verify .env files are properly gitignored
5. âœ… Check session files and documentation for exposed secrets

### Key Accomplishments
- **âœ… Stripe MCP Integration Verified:** Successfully tested Stripe MCP connection and basic operations
- **âœ… Security Audit Completed:** Comprehensive scan found no hardcoded secrets in codebase
- **âœ… Environment Configuration:** Updated .env.development with new VOIP Accelerator Stripe keys
- **âœ… Webhook Setup Guidance:** Provided instructions for obtaining Stripe webhook secrets

### Features Tested
- **Stripe Balance Retrieval:** âœ… Working (test mode, $0.00 USD)
- **Customer Management:** âœ… Working (found existing customer: cus_SgJDVcnoHILPq8)
- **Security Patterns:** âœ… All secrets properly use environment variables

### Security Findings
- **âœ… No Security Issues Found**
- All API keys properly accessed via `import.meta.env.*` pattern
- All `.env*` files correctly listed in `.gitignore`
- Example keys in documentation are clearly marked as placeholders
- 4 environment files properly protected from version control

### Configuration Changes
- **Updated:** `client/.env.development` - New Stripe publishable and secret keys
- **Verified:** All environment files properly gitignored
- **Pending:** Webhook secret still needs to be retrieved from Stripe dashboard

### What Wasn't Completed
- Stripe product/pricing functionality testing (planned for next session)
- Payment links creation testing (planned for next session)
- Invoice operations testing (planned for next session)
- Complete Stripe webhook secret configuration (user was guided to Stripe dashboard)

### Lessons Learned
- Stripe MCP integration is fully functional and ready for comprehensive testing
- Security practices are solid - no hardcoded secrets found anywhere
- Existing webhook endpoints already configured in Stripe dashboard
- Environment variable patterns are consistent across the codebase

### Tips for Future Developers
- Use Stripe MCP tools for testing instead of manual Stripe dashboard operations
- All Stripe operations should go through MCP for consistency
- Webhook secrets are endpoint-specific - get them from individual webhook details
- The staging webhook endpoint `voip-accelerator-staging` is already configured
- Security audit pattern can be reused: search for `sk_|pk_|eyJ` patterns

### Next Session Priorities
1. Complete Stripe webhook secret configuration
2. Test remaining Stripe MCP functionality (products, pricing, payment links, invoices)
3. Update all environment files (.env.staging, .env.production) with new keys
4. Verify Stripe integration works end-to-end with application
