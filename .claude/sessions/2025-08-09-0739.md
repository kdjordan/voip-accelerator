- Deleted Factor Pricing app from AWS Amplify
- Verified Supabase projects already correctly named (voip-accelerator-prod and voip-accelerator-staging)

**Issues Encountered**:
- Docker Desktop was not running initially, preventing edge function deployment
- Hello-world edge function failed to deploy due to missing deno.json file (non-critical)

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Started Docker Desktop to enable edge function deployment
- Successfully deployed all critical edge functions to staging
- Postponed production deployment until other work is complete

**Next Steps**:
- Update Supabase dashboard authentication settings for staging
- Configure Site URL and Redirect URLs in Supabase
- Update any customized email templates
- Continue with staging environment development before production deployment
