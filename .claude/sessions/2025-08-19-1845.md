# Development Session - 2025-08-19 18:45

## Session Overview
**Start Time:** 2025-08-19 18:45  
**Project:** voip-accelerator  
**Branch:** dev  

## Goals
Continue from 2025-08-17 session:
1. Execute Phase 1 Testing Plan (Trial, Optimizer, Accelerator user flows)
2. Implement route guards for upload limit enforcement  
3. Verify Stripe integration and checkout flows
4. Test complete signup → upload → limit → upgrade flow

## Context from Previous Session
- Fixed pricing display (Optimizer $99, Accelerator $249)
- Trial users now show "Free Trial" instead of "Optimizer"
- All upgrade flows use PlanSelectorModal for consistency
- Upload limit system works but route guards not yet implemented
- Changes not committed - ready for testing

## Progress

### Session ended early due to burnout
- Reviewed previous session context from 2025-08-17
- Set up todo list for Phase 1 testing tasks
- Ready to continue tomorrow with testing and route guard implementation

## Next Steps for Tomorrow
1. Start with Phase 1 Testing Plan execution
2. Focus on route guard implementation if testing goes smoothly
3. Keep changes uncommitted until fully tested
