**Summary**: Completed comprehensive Rate Generation feature implementation plan

**Git Changes**:
- Modified: client/src/docs/RATE_GEN.MD
- Current branch: dev-rate-gen (commit: 376d37f)

**Todo Progress**: 5 completed, 0 in progress, 0 pending
- ✓ Completed: Analyze existing codebase architecture (services, stores, components)
- ✓ Completed: Examine current file upload and data processing patterns
- ✓ Completed: Review IndexedDB/DexieJS usage patterns
- ✓ Completed: Study web worker implementation patterns
- ✓ Completed: Create comprehensive RATE_GEN.MD implementation plan

**Details**: 
Created a comprehensive 2,200+ line implementation plan for the Rate Generation feature that includes:

1. **Technical Architecture**: Complete service/store/component structure leveraging 95% of existing infrastructure
2. **UX/UI Design**: Two-column progressive upload with provider naming, dynamic LCR options, analytics dashboard
3. **Integration Points**: Navigation (SparklesIcon + expandable section), authentication (subscription required), database schema
4. **Design System**: Detailed visual consistency requirements matching USFileUploads.vue exactly
5. **Implementation Timeline**: 4-week phased approach with clear deliverables

Key technical decisions finalized:
- Unified storage strategy (all providers in single IndexedDB table) 
- PreviewModal extension with conditional provider naming
- LCR strategy naming ('LCR1', 'LCR2', 'LCR3', 'Average')
- Export integration following USExportModal patterns
- Maximum 5 providers with session-based persistence

The plan is 100% implementation-ready with all architectural, UX, integration, and design decisions documented. Ready to begin Phase 1 development.
