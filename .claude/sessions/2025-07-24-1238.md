## Goals
- [ ] Disable Export Rates functionality during rate adjustments to prevent accidental exports

## Progress

### Update Export Rates button disabled state
- Modified USRateSheetTable.vue to disable Export Rates button when rate adjustment is in progress
- Added `isApplyingAdjustment` to the disabled condition: `:disabled="totalFilteredItems === 0 || isExporting || isApplyingAdjustment"`
- This prevents users from accidentally exporting data while adjustments are being applied
