## Session Overview
**Start Time:** 2025-07-24 12:38

## Goals
- [ ] Disable Export Rates functionality during rate adjustments to prevent accidental exports

## Progress

### Update Export Rates button disabled state ✓
- Modified USRateSheetTable.vue to disable Export Rates button when rate adjustment is in progress
- Added `isApplyingAdjustment` to the disabled condition: `:disabled="totalFilteredItems === 0 || isExporting || isApplyingAdjustment"`
- This prevents users from accidentally exporting data while adjustments are being applied

### Fix Invalid Rows display in AZ Rate Sheet ✓
- Identified issue: The `processRowOptimized` method in AZRateSheetService was creating invalid row objects with wrong structure
- Fixed by updating the invalid row objects to match the `InvalidRow` interface:
  - Changed from `{rowIndex, invalidValue, reason}` to `{destinationName, prefix, invalidRate, rowNumber}`
- Also fixed the error handling case to use the same structure
- This ensures invalid rows display correctly in the UI with proper row data

### Standardize missing value messages in AZ Invalid Rows ✓
- Updated AZ Rate Sheet service to consistently use "N/A" instead of mixed "Missing", "Unknown", "Error" messages
- Changes made in `az-rate-sheet.service.ts`:
  - Missing rate values now show "N/A" instead of "Missing"
  - Missing destination names now show "N/A" instead of "Unknown"
  - Error cases now show "N/A" instead of "Error"
- Updated AZRateSheetView.vue mapping to ensure consistent "N/A" fallbacks
- This provides a cleaner, more consistent user experience

### Apply red color only to actual error values in Invalid Rows ✓
- Updated InvalidRows.vue component to conditionally apply red styling
- Now only cells containing "N/A" are displayed in red (text-red-400)
- Valid values like actual rates (0.15675) or destination names are displayed in normal gray text
- This provides better visual clarity - users can immediately see which specific field caused the row to be invalid

### Fix Global Rate Adjustment destination count display ✓
- Fixed issue where Global Rate Adjustment was showing "0 destinations available"
- Updated `availableDestinationsCount` computed property to show total eligible destinations regardless of whether adjustment value is entered
- Now displays the correct count (e.g., "87 destinations available") immediately, giving users clear information about how many destinations will be affected by the global adjustment

### Remove confusing bucket distribution from Global Rate Adjustment preview ✓
- Removed the "Distribution by bucket" section from the preview that was showing technical rate classifications
- The section was confusing users with irrelevant bucket details like "$0.150000+: 466 destinations"
- Simplified the preview to show only the essential information: rate change examples for first 5 destinations
- Cleaned up related code: removed `bucketDistribution` computed property, `getBucketLabel` method, and unnecessary imports
- This creates a cleaner, more focused user experience

### Update Change badges and effective dates after rate adjustments ✓
- Fixed issue where rate adjustments weren't updating Change badges and effective dates properly
- Updated both `updateDestinationRate` and `bulkUpdateDestinationRates` methods in az-rate-sheet-store.ts
- Now automatically determines change code based on rate comparison:
  - Rate increases → ChangeCode.INCREASE with increaseCustomDate (07/31/2025)
  - Rate decreases → ChangeCode.DECREASE with decreaseCustomDate
  - Same rate → ChangeCode.SAME with sameCustomDate
- After global rate increases, destinations now properly show "INCREASE" badge and correct effective date

### Fix effective date initialization for rate increases ✓
- Fixed effective date showing today's date instead of a week out for rate increases
- Updated `increaseCustomDate` initialization in az-rate-sheet-store.ts to properly calculate 7 days from current date
- Now shows correct future date (07/31/2025) instead of today's date for rate increases

### Implement conflict resolution vs true rate adjustment logic ✓
- Updated rate update methods to distinguish between conflict resolution and true rate changes
- **Conflict Resolution (destinations with rate discrepancies):**
  - Any rate changes are treated as formalization/standardization
  - changeCode remains SAME regardless of rate comparison
  - effective date uses sameCustomDate (no change in effective date)
- **True Rate Adjustments (destinations without conflicts):**
  - Rate changes are treated as actual increases/decreases
  - changeCode updates based on rate comparison (INCREASE/DECREASE/SAME)  
  - effective date updates based on changeCode settings
- This ensures that resolving rate conflicts doesn't incorrectly show as rate increases/decreases
