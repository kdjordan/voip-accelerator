# Development Session - 2025-07-24 12:38

## Session Overview
**Start Time:** 2025-07-24 12:38

## Goals
- [ ] Disable Export Rates functionality during rate adjustments to prevent accidental exports

## Progress

### Update Export Rates button disabled state ✓
- Modified USRateSheetTable.vue to disable Export Rates button when rate adjustment is in progress
- Added `isApplyingAdjustment` to the disabled condition: `:disabled="totalFilteredItems === 0 || isExporting || isApplyingAdjustment"`
- This prevents users from accidentally exporting data while adjustments are being applied

### Fix Invalid Rows display in AZ Rate Sheet ✓
- Identified issue: The `processRowOptimized` method in AZRateSheetService was creating invalid row objects with wrong structure
- Fixed by updating the invalid row objects to match the `InvalidRow` interface:
  - Changed from `{rowIndex, invalidValue, reason}` to `{destinationName, prefix, invalidRate, rowNumber}`
- Also fixed the error handling case to use the same structure
- This ensures invalid rows display correctly in the UI with proper row data

### Standardize missing value messages in AZ Invalid Rows ✓
- Updated AZ Rate Sheet service to consistently use "N/A" instead of mixed "Missing", "Unknown", "Error" messages
- Changes made in `az-rate-sheet.service.ts`:
  - Missing rate values now show "N/A" instead of "Missing"
  - Missing destination names now show "N/A" instead of "Unknown"
  - Error cases now show "N/A" instead of "Error"
- Updated AZRateSheetView.vue mapping to ensure consistent "N/A" fallbacks
- This provides a cleaner, more consistent user experience

### Apply red color only to actual error values in Invalid Rows ✓
- Updated InvalidRows.vue component to conditionally apply red styling
- Now only cells containing "N/A" are displayed in red (text-red-400)
- Valid values like actual rates (0.15675) or destination names are displayed in normal gray text
- This provides better visual clarity - users can immediately see which specific field caused the row to be invalid

### Fix Global Rate Adjustment destination count display ✓
- Fixed issue where Global Rate Adjustment was showing "0 destinations available"
- Updated `availableDestinationsCount` computed property to show total eligible destinations regardless of whether adjustment value is entered
- Now displays the correct count (e.g., "87 destinations available") immediately, giving users clear information about how many destinations will be affected by the global adjustment

### Remove confusing bucket distribution from Global Rate Adjustment preview ✓
- Removed the "Distribution by bucket" section from the preview that was showing technical rate classifications
- The section was confusing users with irrelevant bucket details like "$0.150000+: 466 destinations"
- Simplified the preview to show only the essential information: rate change examples for first 5 destinations
- Cleaned up related code: removed `bucketDistribution` computed property, `getBucketLabel` method, and unnecessary imports
- This creates a cleaner, more focused user experience

### Update Change badges and effective dates after rate adjustments ✓
- Fixed issue where rate adjustments weren't updating Change badges and effective dates properly
- Updated both `updateDestinationRate` and `bulkUpdateDestinationRates` methods in az-rate-sheet-store.ts
- Now automatically determines change code based on rate comparison:
  - Rate increases → ChangeCode.INCREASE with increaseCustomDate (07/31/2025)
  - Rate decreases → ChangeCode.DECREASE with decreaseCustomDate
  - Same rate → ChangeCode.SAME with sameCustomDate
- After global rate increases, destinations now properly show "INCREASE" badge and correct effective date

### Fix effective date initialization for rate increases ✓
- Fixed effective date showing today's date instead of a week out for rate increases
- Updated `increaseCustomDate` initialization in az-rate-sheet-store.ts to properly calculate 7 days from current date
- Now shows correct future date (07/31/2025) instead of today's date for rate increases

### Implement conflict resolution vs true rate adjustment logic ✓
- Updated rate update methods to distinguish between conflict resolution and true rate changes
- **Conflict Resolution (destinations with rate discrepancies):**
  - Any rate changes are treated as formalization/standardization
  - changeCode remains SAME regardless of rate comparison
  - effective date uses sameCustomDate (no change in effective date)
- **True Rate Adjustments (destinations without conflicts):**
  - Rate changes are treated as actual increases/decreases
  - changeCode updates based on rate comparison (INCREASE/DECREASE/SAME)  
  - effective date updates based on changeCode settings
- This ensures that resolving rate conflicts doesn't incorrectly show as rate increases/decreases

### Update - 2025-07-24 3:47 PM

**Summary**: Improved AZ Rate Sheet individual conflict resolution UI layout

**Git Changes**:
- No uncommitted changes (clean working directory)
- Current branch: dev (commit: 2df263b REF: refine AZ Rate Sheet UI for improved clarity and functionality)

**Todo Progress**: 3 completed, 0 in progress, 0 pending
- ✓ Completed: Fix effective date showing today instead of week out for rate increases
- ✓ Completed: Update rate adjustment logic to distinguish between conflict resolution and true rate changes  
- ✓ Completed: Move rate distribution buttons inline with RESOLVE RATE CONFLICT header on same line

**Details**: 
Refined the individual rate conflict resolution interface in AZRateSheetTable.vue:

1. **UI Layout Enhancement**: Moved rate distribution buttons inline with "RESOLVE RATE CONFLICT" header on the same horizontal line for improved workflow efficiency
2. **Code Structure**: Simplified component structure by removing nested divs and making rate buttons direct children of the flex container
3. **Spacing Optimization**: Used proper gap spacing (gap-4 between header and buttons, gap-2 between rate buttons) for clean visual hierarchy
4. **Conflict Resolution Logic**: Implemented sophisticated logic to distinguish between:
   - Rate conflict formalization (keeps changeCode as SAME, no effective date changes)
   - True rate adjustments (updates changeCode and effective dates based on rate comparison)

**Technical Changes**:
- Modified `/client/src/stores/az-rate-sheet-store.ts`: Added discrepancy checking logic to both `updateDestinationRate` and `bulkUpdateDestinationRates` methods
- Updated `/client/src/components/rate-sheet/az/AZRateSheetTable.vue`: Restructured rate conflict UI to place distribution buttons inline with header
- Enhanced user experience by creating a more streamlined conflict resolution workflow

**Impact**: The AZ Rate Sheet now properly handles the critical distinction between resolving existing rate conflicts versus making actual business rate changes, preventing incorrect change tracking and effective date updates during conflict resolution phases.

### Update - 2025-07-24 6:11 PM

**Summary**: Identified and resolved LERG data integrity issue with country names

**Git Changes**:
- Modified: .claude/sessions/2025-07-24-1238.md
- Modified: client/src/components/exports/USExportPreview.vue
- Current branch: dev (commit: 2df263b REF: refine AZ Rate Sheet UI for improved clarity and functionality)

**Todo Progress**: 1 completed, 0 in progress, 0 pending
- ✓ Completed: Debug NJ showing instead of US in export options country list

**Issue Identified**: 
The USExportFormatOptions component was showing "NJ" in the countries list instead of "United States". Investigation revealed that the enhanced_lerg table in Supabase had incorrect data where:
- Records with country_code='US' had state names (like "New Jersey") in the country_name field
- Records with country_code='CA' had province names instead of "Canada" in the country_name field

**Root Cause**: Data integrity issue in the Supabase enhanced_lerg table where country_name field contained state/province names instead of proper country names.

**Solution Provided**: 
Created SQL update commands to fix the data directly in Supabase:
- UPDATE statements to set country_name='United States' for all US records
- UPDATE statements to set country_name='Canada' for all CA records
- Verification queries to confirm the updates

**Next Steps**: User will run the SQL commands in Supabase to fix the data, then refresh the application to see corrected country names in the export options.

### Update - 2025-07-24 7:33 PM

- Current branch: dev (commit: 2df263b REF: refine AZ Rate Sheet UI for improved clarity and functionality)

**Todo Progress**: 1 completed, 0 in progress, 0 pending
- ✓ Completed: Deploy get-enhanced-lerg-data edge function

**Details**: 
Successfully completed the edge function deployment that was interrupted earlier. The `get-enhanced-lerg-data` function is now live and operational:

1. **Deployment Success**: Function deployed without errors to Supabase with proper CORS handling
2. **Functionality Verified**: Tested via curl and confirmed the API returns complete enhanced LERG data with proper structure
3. **Data Integrity Confirmed**: Verified that country names are now showing correctly ("United States", "Canada") instead of state/province names
4. **API Response Structure**: Confirmed the function returns data, stats, and metadata as expected with proper regional categorization

**Technical Notes**:
- Function deployed to: `https://odnwqnmgftgjrdkotlro.supabase.co/functions/v1/get-enhanced-lerg-data`
- Returns 449+ LERG records with full geographic context
- Regional stats calculation working (US, CA, Caribbean, Pacific regions)
- CORS headers properly configured for client access

**Impact**: The enhanced LERG data API is now fully operational and ready for integration with the front-end application. This completes the LERG infrastructure improvements and resolves the country name display issues in export functionality.
