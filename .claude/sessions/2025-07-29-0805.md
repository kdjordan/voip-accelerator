# Development Session - July 29, 2025 08:05

## Session Overview
- **Start Time:** July 29, 2025 08:05
- **Project:** Factor Pricing
- **Branch:** dev

## Goals
- Improve rate generation UI based on user feedback
- Remove unnecessary preview section from results
- Add provider contribution percentages to deck overview

## Progress

### Rate Generation UI Improvements ✅
Completed UI refinements for the rate generation results page based on user feedback:

1. **Removed Preview Section** ✅
   - Eliminated the rate preview table that was showing first 10 rates
   - User feedback: "not providing any actionable information"
   - Cleaned up component by removing ~40 lines of code

2. **Provider Contribution Percentages** ✅
   - Implemented provider statistics calculation from generated rates
   - Added `calculateAllDeckProviderStats()` function to analyze rate contributions
   - Stores provider counts in a Map structure for efficient lookup
   - Calculates percentage of total rates each provider contributed

3. **Enhanced Provider Display** ✅
   - Replaced "3 providers" text with stacked provider names
   - Shows percentage contribution next to each provider name
   - Limited display to top 3 providers with "+X more" indicator
   - Added proper truncation and hover tooltips for long provider names
   - Shows "Calculating..." while stats are being computed

4. **Auto-refresh on New Generation** ✅
   - Added watch on store.generatedDeck to detect new generations
   - Automatically reloads deck list and recalculates stats
   - Ensures UI stays in sync with latest data

### Technical Implementation
- **Provider Stats Calculation**: Iterates through all generated rates in IndexedDB, groups by deckId and selectedProvider
- **Performance**: Calculation runs asynchronously to avoid blocking UI
- **Data Structure**: Uses Map<deckId, Map<providerName, count>> for efficient lookups
- **Display Logic**: Sorts providers by percentage descending, shows top 3

### Files Modified
- `/client/src/components/rate-gen/RateGenResults.vue` - Main UI updates and provider stats logic

### Additional UI Cleanup ✅
Based on further user feedback, made these improvements:

1. **Removed Eyeball/Load Icon** ✅
   - Eliminated confusing "load deck" functionality that served no purpose
   - All operations (export, validate, delete) work without loading
   - Removed associated code: `handleLoadDeck()`, `loadRatesForCurrentDeck()`, `currentDeck`, `currentDeckId`
   - Cleaned up ~20 lines of unnecessary code

2. **Renamed Column Header** ✅
   - Changed "LCR STRATEGY" to "STRATEGY"
   - Accounts for "Average" strategy option which isn't LCR-based
   - More accurate representation of the feature

3. **Code Cleanup** ✅
   - Removed unused imports (EyeIcon)
   - Removed unused state variables (loadedRates)
   - Removed highlight styling for "current" deck
   - Simplified export function by removing unnecessary deck loading

### Button Placement Update ✅
Per user request, improved UI layout:

1. **Moved Generate New Deck Button** ✅
   - Relocated from top of table to bottom right
   - Better visual flow - action follows content
   - Only shows when there are existing decks
   - Maintains same functionality and disabled state logic
