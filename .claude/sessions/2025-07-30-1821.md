**Todo Progress**: 3 completed, 0 in progress, 0 pending
- ✓ Completed: Add 'Finalizing Rate Deck' message when generation reaches 100%
- ✓ Completed: Change 'TOTAL RATES' header to 'TOTAL CODES' in Rate Generation History
- ✓ Completed: Document and explain LCR strategies implementation

**Key Improvements**:

1. **Enhanced User Feedback During Generation**
   - Added "Finalizing Rate Deck..." message when progress reaches 100%
   - Prevents user confusion during the 10-second IndexedDB storage phase
   - Added detailed console logging to track finalization progress

2. **Improved Terminology**
   - Changed "TOTAL RATES" to "TOTAL CODES" in rate generation history
   - Better reflects that values represent NPANXX codes, not individual rates
   - Updated both header and comment for consistency

3. **Identified Finalization Delay Cause**
   - Delay is caused by storing rates to IndexedDB in 5,000-record chunks
   - For 29,547 rates = 6 chunks = ~10 seconds
   - No LERG/NPA mapping occurs during this phase

4. **Deep Dive: LCR Strategy Implementation**
   - **LCR1**: Selects cheapest rate (maximum savings, highest risk)
   - **LCR2**: Selects 2nd cheapest (balanced approach)
   - **LCR3-5**: Progressively more conservative selections
   - **Average**: Mathematical average of all provider rates
   - Each rate type (Interstate/Intrastate/Indeterminate) calculated independently
   - Different providers can be selected for different jurisdictions

**Technical Insights**:
- Zero rates ($0.00) are filtered out before LCR calculations
- Fallback logic ensures selection even with fewer providers than LCR depth
- Debug information stored for validation and troubleshooting
- Provider shown in UI is based on Interstate selection only
