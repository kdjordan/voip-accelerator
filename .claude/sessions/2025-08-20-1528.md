### Update - 2025-08-20 3:45 PM

**Summary**: Successfully resolved all Supabase security issues on staging database

**Git Changes**:
- Modified: .claude/docs/TESTING_USER_FLOW.md, client/src/components/shared/ServiceExpiryBanner.vue, client/src/stores/user-store.ts
- Added: 3 new security migration files (supabase/migrations/20250820_*.sql)
- Added: 2 session files
- Current branch: dev (commit: e33c712)

**Todo Progress**: 7 completed, 0 in progress, 0 pending
- ‚úì Completed: Investigate missing search_path parameter warnings in Supabase functions
- ‚úì Completed: List and examine all Supabase edge functions
- ‚úì Completed: Check edge function implementations for search_path issues
- ‚úì Completed: Fix search_path parameter in all affected functions
- ‚úì Completed: Address leaked password protection issue in Auth
- ‚úì Completed: Test and verify all security fixes
- ‚úì Completed: Find and fix remaining function issues in stripe schema

**Security Issues Resolved**:
- **Function Search Path Mutable**: Added `SET search_path` to 12+ database functions across public, stripe, and storage schemas
- **RLS Disabled**: Enabled Row Level Security on upload_history and active_sessions tables with proper policies
- **Edge Functions**: Verified all edge functions are secure (no issues found)

**Database Changes Applied (Staging)**:
- `20250820_fix_security_issues.sql` - Fixed core upload tracking functions and RLS policies
- `20250820_fix_security_individual_functions.sql` - Fixed remaining individual functions
- `20250820_fix_reset_monthly_uploads_functions.sql` - Fixed overloaded reset functions

**Outstanding Manual Action**:
- **Leaked Password Protection**: Must be enabled manually in Supabase dashboard (Auth ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Password strength and leaked password protection)

**Issues Encountered**: 
- Function signature conflicts with overloaded reset_monthly_uploads functions
- Required dropping and recreating functions to preserve exact signatures

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Preserved exact function signatures while adding security parameters
- Used conditional migrations to handle schema differences
- Applied security hardening without breaking functionality

**Testing Status**: All migrations applied successfully to staging database. Security advisor now shows only manual password protection setting remaining.

### Update - 2025-08-20 4:05 PM

**Summary**: Explored Supabase native session management vs custom implementation, decided to keep hand-rolled solution for cost reasons

**Git Changes**:
- Modified: .claude/docs/TESTING_USER_FLOW.md, client/src/components/shared/ServiceExpiryBanner.vue, client/src/stores/user-store.ts, supabase/functions/stripe-events/index.ts
- Added: 3 security migration files, 2 session files
- Current branch: dev (commit: e33c712)

**Todo Progress**: 7 completed, 0 in progress, 0 pending
- All security-related todos completed successfully

**Key Findings**:
- **Supabase Native Solution Available**: Discovered Supabase has built-in "Single session per user" functionality in Auth settings
- **Cost Consideration**: Feature requires Pro Plan ($25/month) - not justified until revenue validation
- **Current Solution Validated**: Hand-rolled session management system is working well and provides equivalent functionality
- **Security Status**: All critical database security issues resolved, only optional paid features remain

**Decision Made**: 
- Keep existing custom session management system (`active_sessions` table + cleanup functions)
- Defer Supabase native session features until revenue validation
- Current implementation provides same functionality at no additional cost

**Security Audit Complete**: 
- ‚úÖ All function search_path vulnerabilities fixed
- ‚úÖ Row Level Security enabled on public tables  
- ‚úÖ Edge functions verified secure
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Leaked password protection requires paid plan (optional enhancement)

**Status**: Ready for user testing and validation of business model before considering plan upgrades.
