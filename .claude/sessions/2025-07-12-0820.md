# Development Session - 2025-07-12 08:20

## Session Overview

**Start Time:** July 12, 2025 at 8:20 AM  
**Project:** VoIP Accelerator - AZ Comparison Table Enhancement

## Goals

Based on the recent work completed, continuing development on:

1. **AZ Comparison Table Refinements** - Building on the recent UI simplification and rate groups functionality
2. **CSV Export Enhancements** - Following up on the metadata header and formatting improvements
3. **User Experience Optimization** - Any additional UX improvements for the AZ rate comparison workflow
4. **Performance & Quality** - Address any performance issues or data quality concerns in the comparison system

*Note: Please clarify specific goals for this session or confirm if we should continue with AZ comparison system improvements.*

## Progress

*Session progress will be tracked here...*

---

### Recent Context (Pre-Session)
- ✅ Removed summary statistics from AZ destination headers  
- ✅ Enabled rate groups view for all destinations (removed 20-code threshold)
- ✅ Enhanced CSV export with metadata headers and VOIPAccelerator.com branding
- ✅ Fixed rate formatting to use 6-decimal precision numbers instead of currency
- ✅ Streamlined export columns (removed first 4 redundant columns)

### Update - 2025-07-12 08:45 AM

**Summary**: Implemented data-driven upload progress indicators across US file upload components

**Git Changes**:
- Modified: client/src/components/us/USFileUploads.vue, client/src/pages/USRateSheetView.vue
- Added: client/src/components/shared/UploadProgressIndicator.vue
- Modified: client/src/composables/exports/useCSVExport.ts
- Current branch: dev (commit: 35badc8)

**Todo Progress**: 3 completed, 0 in progress, 0 pending
- ✓ Completed: Created reusable UploadProgressIndicator component with configurable row processing rates
- ✓ Completed: Integrated progress tracking into USRateSheetView with real row counting
- ✓ Completed: Extended progress system to USFileUploads dual-component architecture

**Details**: 
Built a sophisticated upload progress system based on real performance metrics (14-15k rows/sec). The system:

1. **UploadProgressIndicator Component**: Configurable progress bar with stages (Reading → Validating → Storing), time estimates, and privacy-focused messaging ("Storing on your browser")

2. **USRateSheetView Integration**: Eliminated spinner flash by counting rows before showing progress, with proper cleanup on success/error/cancel paths

3. **USFileUploads Dual-Component Support**: Complex implementation handling two independent upload zones (us1/us2) with component-specific state tracking, cross-component validation, and isolated progress indicators

**Technical Implementation**:
- Row counting via Papa.parse step function before file processing
- Stage-based progress with weighted completion (25% reading, 35% validating, 40% storing)
- Component-specific state management using reactive objects
- Privacy messaging emphasizing local browser storage
- Comprehensive cleanup on all exit paths (success, error, cancel, file removal)

**UX Improvements**:
- Replaced indefinite spinners with realistic progress indicators
- Shows actual row counts and time remaining estimates
- Emphasizes data privacy with "Storing on your browser" messaging
- Eliminates spinner flash by ensuring progress data is ready before display

**Architecture Notes**: 
Carefully preserved existing complex state management in USFileUploads while adding progress tracking that doesn't interfere between dual upload zones. Each component (us1/us2) maintains isolated progress state with proper cross-component blocking behavior.
