**Critical Findings**:
- Production environment is severely outdated with missing Enhanced LERG system (450 NPAs vs 440)
- Complete Stripe billing infrastructure missing (0 of 3 edge functions)
- 11 new/updated edge functions need deployment
- Pacific NPA fixes required for correct billing categorization (NPAs 670, 671, 684)

- Created risk assessment with mitigation strategies
- Defined success criteria and team assignments

**Migration Plan Created**: PROD_MIGRATE.md with:
- Phase 1: Pre-migration preparation (2-3 days)
- Phase 2: Core migration (1-2 days)
- Phase 3: Edge function deployment (1 day)
- Phase 4: Integration testing (1-2 days)
- Phase 5: Cleanup & optimization (1 day)

**Next Steps**: User approval required to proceed with Phase 1 preparation and backups.
