**Technical Achievements**:

1. **Unified Subscription Management**: 
   - Single `ServiceExpiryBanner` component handles all expiry scenarios
   - Personalized messages: "Your free trial has expired...", "Your monthly plan has expired...", etc.
   - Clean state management in Pinia store with `getServiceExpiryBanner` getter

2. **Dashboard Architecture Refactor**:
   - `AccountBillingCard`: Unified billing & subscription management
   - `ProfileSettingsCard`: Clean profile management with proper danger zone
   - Eliminated redundant "Subscription Status" and duplicate "Account Settings" sections
   - Maintained beautiful dark bento card aesthetic

3. **Banner Flashing Fix**:
   - Root cause: Router transition `mode="out-in"` kept old component visible during navigation
   - Admin route guard redirected to dashboard instead of proper access denied page
   - Solution: Removed transitions + created `AccessDeniedView.vue` for non-admin users

4. **UI/UX Polish**:
   - Current Plan now uses `BaseBadge` component for consistency
   - Email input properly aligned and sized
   - Action buttons right-aligned with appropriate sizing
   - Clean information hierarchy and logical grouping

**Code Quality Improvements**:
- Removed fragmented trial logic from multiple components
- Consolidated 100+ lines of redundant subscription display code
- Clean component props and event handling
- Proper separation of billing vs profile concerns

**Issues Resolved**:
- Banner flashing when navigating to admin routes
- Triple redundancy in subscription status display
- Inconsistent UI spacing and alignment
- Poor information architecture in dashboard

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Unified banner system with centralized logic
- Clean component separation (billing vs profile)
- Proper router guard flow (admin â†’ access denied, not dashboard)
- Consistent design system usage (BaseBadge, BaseButton sizing)

**User Experience Impact**:
- Eliminated confusing duplicate subscription information
- Clean, logical dashboard layout with proper hierarchy
- No more jarring banner flashes during navigation  
- Professional, cohesive design language throughout

**Status**: ðŸŽ‰ Dashboard refactor complete - production ready with unified subscription management
