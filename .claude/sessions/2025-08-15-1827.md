# Development Session - 2025-08-15 18:27

## Session Overview
**Start Time:** 2025-08-15 18:27  
**Project:** VoIP Accelerator  
**Branch:** dev  

## Goals
- [ ] Implement upload file tracking system for Optimizer tier (100 uploads/month limit)
- [ ] Create centralized `useUploadTracking` composable to avoid code duplication
- [ ] Integrate tracking into all file upload zones (AZ/US rate sheets)
- [ ] Add upload counter to Dashboard with visual progress indicators
- [ ] Implement monthly reset logic based on subscription billing cycle

## Progress

### Clarifying Questions for Implementation

1. **Upload Limits Clarification**: 
   - PRICING_TIERS_IMPLEMENTATION.md shows: Accelerator (100), Optimizer (unlimited), Enterprise (unlimited)
   - Previous session notes show: Optimizer (100), Accelerator (1000), Enterprise (5000)
   - **Which configuration is correct?**
   Only the accelerator has a monthly upload limit. Which currently is 100 files total per month let me know if you think we should adjust that total

2. **Reset Timing**: 
   - Option A: User's subscription billing date (30 days from last payment)?
   - Option B: Calendar month (1st of each month)?
   - Option C: Anniversary of first subscription?
   - **Which reset strategy should we use?**
   Option A : While the users on a free trial, we should keep track of how many uploads they do but then when they run out of the free tile and actually subscribe then we reset it then and then they have 100 uploads or whatever we decide it's gonna be fine we need to make that configurable so we need to have that be a environment variable just in case we need to adjust that later

3. **What Counts as an Upload**:
   - Option A: Each file individually (bulk upload of 5 files = 5 uploads)
   - Option B: Each upload action (bulk upload of 5 files = 1 upload)
   - Option C: Different counting for different file types
   - **How should we count uploads?**
   This is a global counter so every time we upload a file to any of the inputs any of the file inputs that's going to count as one

4. **Database Fields**:
   - Existing: `uploads` (int4), `uploads_this_month` (int4), `uploads_reset_date` (date)
   - **Should we use these existing fields or create new ones?**
   Actually, we wanna track this individually so we can create metrics for marketing. So we should have a total_uploads a uploads_this_month and I'm not sure if we need an upload_reset_date because we have the stripe expires_at or something like that which tells us when the subscription is going to expire so if we can reuse that then great if we need to track it separately, I'm fine with that too

5. **Enforcement Strategy**:
   - Option A: Hard block when limit reached (no uploads allowed)
   - Option B: Soft warning with ability to continue (track overage)
   - **How strictly should we enforce limits?**
   Let's do option a let's do a block with a hard limit and we will launch the upgrade your subscription model, which will probably need to create but for now let's just work on the functionality and not work about that and not worry about the upsell right now

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Database & Configuration (Immediate)
1. **Add `total_uploads` field** to profiles table for lifetime tracking
2. **Reuse existing fields**: `uploads_this_month`, `uploads_reset_date` 
3. **Add environment variable**: `VITE_ACCELERATOR_UPLOAD_LIMIT=100`
4. **Reset logic**: Use `plan_expires_at` for billing cycle reset timing

#### Phase 2: Core Composable (30 mins)
Create `useUploadTracking.ts` with:
- `checkUploadLimit()` - Pre-upload validation
- `incrementUpload()` - Increment both total and monthly counters
- `getUploadStats()` - Current usage for dashboard
- `resetMonthlyUploads()` - Called when subscription renews
- Integration with user store for reactive updates

#### Phase 3: Integration Points (1 hour)
File upload locations identified:
1. `/components/az/AZFileUploads.vue` - AZ rate sheets
2. `/components/us/USFileUploads.vue` - US rate sheets  
3. `/components/rate-gen/RateGenFileUploads.vue` - Rate generator
4. `/pages/AZRateSheetView.vue` - Direct AZ uploads
5. `/pages/USRateSheetView.vue` - Direct US uploads

#### Phase 4: User Experience (45 mins)
1. **Dashboard counter**: "23/100 uploads this month" with progress bar
2. **Pre-upload check**: Block with message when limit reached
3. **Warning at 80%**: "You've used 80 uploads this month"
4. **Hard block modal**: "Upload limit reached. Upgrade to Optimizer for unlimited uploads"

#### Phase 5: Edge Function (30 mins)
Create `track-upload` edge function for:
- Atomic increment operations
- Reset validation based on billing cycle
- Return current stats after operation

### Technical Decisions Made

1. **Counting Strategy**: Each file = 1 upload (bulk upload of 5 = 5 uploads)
2. **Reset Timing**: Based on subscription billing date (when trial ends or payment processed)
3. **Trial Handling**: Track uploads during trial, reset on subscription
4. **Enforcement**: Hard block at limit (no overages)
5. **Database Strategy**: 
   - Use existing `uploads_this_month` and `uploads_reset_date`
   - Add new `total_uploads` for marketing metrics
   - Use `plan_expires_at` for billing cycle tracking

### Architecture Overview

```
User Action → Pre-upload Check → Upload File → Track Upload → Update UI
                    ↓                              ↓
              Block if limit      Edge Function (atomic increment)
                    ↓                              ↓
              Show Upgrade Modal        Update both counters
```

### Risk Mitigation
- **Race conditions**: Edge function ensures atomic operations
- **Failed uploads**: Only track successful uploads
- **Network issues**: Local optimistic updates with server sync
- **Migration**: Existing users start with 0 uploads (clean slate)

### Tasks Completed

#### ✅ Phase 1: Database Migration - COMPLETE
1. **Added `total_uploads` column** to profiles table for lifetime tracking
2. **Created 4 SQL functions** for upload management:
   - `check_upload_limit()` - Pre-upload validation with tier support
   - `increment_upload_count()` - Atomic increment with limit checking
   - `reset_monthly_uploads()` - For subscription renewals
   - `get_upload_statistics()` - Dashboard statistics
3. **Added performance index** for upload tracking queries
4. **Verified Stripe compatibility** - All pricing intact ($99/$249/$499)
5. **Environment variable** already configured: `VITE_ACCELERATOR_UPLOAD_LIMIT=100`

### Notes & Observations

#### Migration Applied Successfully to Staging
- Direct SQL execution via Supabase MCP tools (bypassed CLI sync issues)
- All functions created with proper SECURITY DEFINER for RLS bypass
- Backwards compatible - existing users initialized with 0 uploads
- Reset logic uses `plan_expires_at` for billing cycle synchronization

#### Key Technical Decisions Implemented
- **Atomic operations** prevent race conditions
- **Tier-aware logic**: Accelerator=100 limit, Optimizer/Enterprise=unlimited
- **Trial handling**: Same limits as Accelerator, resets on subscription
- **Smart reset timing**: Based on billing cycle, not calendar month

#### ✅ Phase 2: Core Composable - COMPLETE
1. **Enhanced existing composable** at `src/composables/useUploadTracking.ts`
2. **Backwards compatible** - kept all existing methods working
3. **New database-integrated methods**:
   - `checkUploadLimitAsync()` - Real-time limit checking
   - `incrementUploadCount()` - Atomic upload tracking
   - `getUploadStatistics()` - Dashboard statistics
   - `validateBeforeUpload()` - Pre-upload validation
4. **Helper functions** for UI display and messaging
5. **Environment variable integration** - Uses `VITE_ACCELERATOR_UPLOAD_LIMIT`
6. **Reactive state management** - Integrates with existing user store
