2. **Upload Field Management**: Added total_uploads, uploads_this_month, and uploads_reset_date tracking throughout system
3. **User Details Modal Enhancement**: Replaced "Rate Sheets" with "Total Uploads", "Total Logins" with "Uploads This Month", added edit capability for super admins
4. **Activity Display Fix**: Changed "Days Active" to show actual last activity in relative time format (e.g., "2h ago", "5d ago")
5. **Database Schema Alignment**: Fixed edge function queries to match actual database schema, eliminated field mismatch errors

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Backend**: Enhanced edge functions with proper field validation and upload statistics support
- **Frontend**: Comprehensive UI updates for upload management with edit modes and form validation
- **Data Flow**: Complete integration from Supabase → Edge Functions → Composables → Store → UI Components
- **User Experience**: Super admin can now view and edit user upload statistics directly from User Details modal

**System Status**: ✅ PRODUCTION READY - User management system fully operational with upload tracking capabilities
