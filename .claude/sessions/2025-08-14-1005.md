~# Development Session - 2025-08-14 10:05

## Session Overview
- **Start Time**: 2025-08-14 10:05
- **Project**: VoIP Accelerator
- **Branch**: dev

## Goals
1. Complete Stripe webhook configuration for automated subscription updates
2. Test end-to-end payment flow (trial ‚Üí checkout ‚Üí payment ‚Üí database update)
3. Verify all three pricing tiers work correctly
4. Document any remaining issues or next steps

## Progress

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks
1. **Database Manual Testing** - Successfully updated user profile manually to verify database permissions work
2. **Webhook Configuration** - Fixed webhook secret mismatch issues and aligned Stripe account consistency
3. **Product Creation** - Recreated all Stripe products (Optimizer $99, Accelerator $249, Enterprise $499) with proper descriptions
4. **Environment Variables** - Updated all price IDs in both .env.development and Supabase secrets
5. **Checkout Flow** - Fixed checkout session creation, users can now complete payments successfully

### ‚ùå Current Critical Issue
**Webhook Processing Failure** - Despite successful checkout completion, the stripe-sync webhook is not updating the user's profile in the database.

**Symptoms:**
- Checkout completes successfully ‚úÖ
- User gets redirected back to app ‚úÖ  
- Database profile remains on "trial" status ‚ùå
- No stripe.events records being created ‚ùå
- Getting 429 rate limit errors when testing webhook ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The 429 "Too Many Requests" error suggests either:
1. Rate limiting from excessive testing, OR
2. Code issue causing rapid-fire API calls in webhook processing

**Integration**: Hook into all file upload zones without code duplication
**Limits**: Trial (10), Optimizer (100), Accelerator (1000), Enterprise (5000)
**Reset Logic**: Monthly based on subscription billing cycle
**UI Updates**: Dashboard counter, progress bars, limit warnings

---

## üìã **NEXT SESSION: Upload Tracking Implementation**

### **Core Objective**
Implement a centralized upload tracking system that increments the `uploads` field in the profiles table whenever a user uploads files. This will be crucial for enforcing subscription tier limits.

### **1. Database Schema Analysis**
First, I need to understand the current `uploads` column:
- **Field**: `uploads` (int4) in profiles table
- **Purpose**: Track total lifetime uploads per user
- **Reset Logic**: Needs monthly reset based on subscription billing cycle

### **2. Composable Architecture** 
Create `useUploadTracking.ts` composable with:

**State Management:**
```typescript
interface UploadTrackingState {
currentMonthUploads: number
totalUploads: number
uploadLimit: number
isNearLimit: boolean
canUpload: boolean
}
```

**Core Functions:**
- `incrementUpload()` - Increment count in DB and state
- `checkUploadLimit()` - Validate against tier limits
- `resetMonthlyUploads()` - Reset counter (webhook triggered)
- `getUploadStats()` - Get current usage statistics

### **3. Upload Limit Configuration**
Based on pricing tiers from environment variables:
```typescript
const UPLOAD_LIMITS = {
trial: 10,
optimizer: 100,   // From VITE_ACCELERATOR_UPLOAD_LIMIT 
accelerator: 1000, // Unlimited scaling
enterprise: 5000  // High volume
}
```

### **4. Integration Points**
Identify all file upload zones in the application:

**Current Upload Areas:**
- Rate sheet uploads
- Bulk file processing
- Document attachments
- Profile picture uploads
- Any CSV/Excel imports

**Integration Method:**
- Hook into existing upload functions
- Call `incrementUpload()` after successful upload
- Show upload limit warnings before upload
- Block uploads when limit exceeded

### **5. User Experience Enhancements**

**Dashboard Updates:**
- Add "Uploads This Month: X/100" to Profile Settings
- Progress bar showing upload usage
- Warning when approaching limit (80%+)

**Upload Zones:**
- Pre-upload limit checking
- Clear error messages when limit exceeded
- Upgrade prompts for trial users

### **6. Database Schema Updates**
May need additional fields:
```sql
-- Potential new columns
monthly_uploads: int4     -- Current month count
last_upload_reset: timestamptz  -- When monthly counter was reset
```

### **7. Implementation Phases**

**Phase 1: Core Composable**
- Create `useUploadTracking.ts`
- Implement basic increment/check functions
- Add to user store integration

**Phase 2: Upload Zone Integration**
- Find all upload locations
- Integrate tracking calls
- Add limit validation

**Phase 3: UI/UX Updates**
- Dashboard upload counter
- Progress indicators
- Limit warnings

**Phase 4: Monthly Reset System**
- Webhook for billing cycle resets
- Automated cleanup processes

### **8. Questions to Resolve**

1. **Reset Timing**: Should uploads reset on:
- Calendar month (1st of each month)?
- Subscription billing date (30 days from last payment)?
- Fixed date regardless of subscription?

2. **Limit Enforcement**: Should we:
- Hard block uploads when limit reached?
- Allow overage with warnings?
- Different rules for different file types?

3. **Granularity**: Track by:
- Total file count?
- File size?
- Both?

4. **Trial Users**: How to handle:
- Users without subscriptions?
- Expired trials?

### **9. Technical Considerations**

- **Concurrency**: Handle simultaneous uploads
- **Error Handling**: What if DB update fails after upload?
- **Performance**: Batch updates for bulk uploads
- **Caching**: Local state vs DB consistency

---

**üí° Ready for next session with fresh energy to answer these questions and implement the system!**

2. **Problem**: 429 Rate limiting from Stripe
- **Solution**: Removed dynamic API calls, used static pricing

3. **Problem**: Next billing date showing year 2025 instead of 2024
- **Solution**: Fixed date calculation logic in webhook

4. **Problem**: Dashboard layout broken with overlapping elements
- **Solution**: Restructured layout with proper flexbox containers

5. **Problem**: Missing `last_payment_date` in database
- **Solution**: Added field update in webhook processing

### **Breaking Changes**
- None - All changes were additive or fixes

### **Configuration Changes**
1. **Supabase Config**: Added `[functions.stripe-events]` with `verify_jwt = false`
2. **Environment Variables**: Updated all Stripe price IDs
3. **Webhook Secret**: Updated to match correct endpoint

### **Deployment Steps Taken**
1. Deployed `stripe-events` function multiple times with fixes
2. Updated Supabase secrets with correct Stripe keys
3. Configured webhook endpoint in Stripe dashboard

### **Dependencies Added/Removed**
- None - Used existing Stripe and Supabase dependencies

### **Lessons Learned**
1. **Webhook Authentication**: Supabase Edge Functions require JWT by default, must explicitly disable for external webhooks
2. **Rate Limiting**: Avoid unnecessary API calls in frequently accessed components
3. **Date Handling**: JavaScript date manipulation requires careful handling to avoid unexpected results
4. **UI Layout**: Flexbox with proper constraints prevents overlap issues
5. **Debugging Webhooks**: Console logging in edge functions is crucial for troubleshooting

### **What Wasn't Completed**
- Upload tracking system implementation (planned for next session)
- Webhook handling for subscription updates/cancellations
- Email notifications for subscription events
- Invoice generation and display

### **Tips for Future Developers**
1. **Always check Supabase logs** when edge functions fail silently
2. **Use `verify_jwt = false`** for any external webhook endpoints
3. **Test webhooks locally** with Stripe CLI before production deployment
4. **Keep pricing static** in frontend to avoid rate limiting
5. **Document environment variables** clearly for price IDs
6. **Use badges consistently** for status indicators
7. **Plan database schema** for tracking features early (like upload counts)     
8. **Consider billing cycle timing** for feature resets (monthly vs calendar)

### **Next Session Ready**
Upload tracking system fully planned with:
- Architecture design complete
- Implementation phases defined
- Critical questions documented
- Technical considerations outlined

**Session successfully documented and ready for handoff!** üöÄ
