# Development Session - 2025-08-14 10:05

## Session Overview
- **Start Time**: 2025-08-14 10:05
- **Project**: VoIP Accelerator
- **Branch**: dev

## Goals
1. Complete Stripe webhook configuration for automated subscription updates
2. Test end-to-end payment flow (trial ‚Üí checkout ‚Üí payment ‚Üí database update)
3. Verify all three pricing tiers work correctly
4. Document any remaining issues or next steps

## Progress

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks
1. **Database Manual Testing** - Successfully updated user profile manually to verify database permissions work
2. **Webhook Configuration** - Fixed webhook secret mismatch issues and aligned Stripe account consistency
3. **Product Creation** - Recreated all Stripe products (Optimizer $99, Accelerator $249, Enterprise $499) with proper descriptions
4. **Environment Variables** - Updated all price IDs in both .env.development and Supabase secrets
5. **Checkout Flow** - Fixed checkout session creation, users can now complete payments successfully

### ‚ùå Current Critical Issue
**Webhook Processing Failure** - Despite successful checkout completion, the stripe-sync webhook is not updating the user's profile in the database.

**Symptoms:**
- Checkout completes successfully ‚úÖ
- User gets redirected back to app ‚úÖ  
- Database profile remains on "trial" status ‚ùå
- No stripe.events records being created ‚ùå
- Getting 429 rate limit errors when testing webhook ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The 429 "Too Many Requests" error suggests either:
1. Rate limiting from excessive testing, OR
2. Code issue causing rapid-fire API calls in webhook processing
