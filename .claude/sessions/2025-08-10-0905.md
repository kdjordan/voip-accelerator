**Project:** VOIP Accelerator
**Branch:** dev

## Goals

- [ ] Ensure subscription period fields are properly initialized for trial users
- [ ] Get staging and development branches working properly
- [ ] Prepare for production deployment after staging is verified

## Progress

### Tasks Completed
- [x] Diagnosed issue: `handle_new_user_trial()` trigger not setting `current_period_start` and `current_period_end`
- [x] Applied migration to staging database to fix trial subscription periods
- [x] Fixed existing user's NULL subscription period fields
- [x] Removed unused columns: `user_agent`, `signup_method`
- [x] Added `uploads` column (INTEGER, default 0) for marketing analytics tracking
- [x] Redesigned Profile Settings UI with prominent trial/subscription banners and better CTA placement
- [x] Updated pricing throughout codebase: $99/month, $1089/year (was $40/$400, then $900/$9000)

### Notes
- Working only on staging environment (odnwqnmgftgjrdkotlro) in this session
- Production deployment will happen after staging verification
- Found unused columns: `user_agent`, `signup_method` (not being set anywhere)
- Trial users should have 7-day trial with proper period dates

### Next Steps
- Test new user signup in staging to verify fix
- Update existing NULL subscription periods for current users
- Consider cleaning up unused columns

### Update - 2025-08-11 Session Management Implementation ✅ PHASE 1 & 2 COMPLETE

**🎯 MAJOR MILESTONE**: Successfully implemented complete backend infrastructure for session management and Enterprise multi-seat functionality.

**Phase 1: Database Schema ✅ COMPLETE**
- ✅ **Organizations Table**: Enterprise organizations with multi-seat billing (10 seat limit, custom pricing beyond)
- ✅ **Profiles Enhancement**: Added `organization_id`, `subscription_tier` (starter/professional/enterprise), `uploads_this_month`, `uploads_reset_date`
- ✅ **Active Sessions Table**: Session tracking with heartbeat system, user agent, IP address, browser info
- ✅ **Organization Invitations**: Secure token-based invitations with expiry, role management
- ✅ **RLS Policies**: Comprehensive row-level security for all new tables
- ✅ **Database Migration**: Successfully applied to staging environment (odnwqnmgftgjrdkotlro)

**Phase 2: Backend Edge Functions ✅ COMPLETE**
- ✅ **Session Management** (`manage-session`): Validates single sessions for Starter/Pro, unlimited for Enterprise
- ✅ **Upload Tracking** (`track-upload`): Enforces 100 uploads/month for Starter tier, auto-resets monthly (UTC)
- ✅ **Organization Management** (`create-organization`): Creates Enterprise orgs with admin assignment
- ✅ **User Invitations** (`invite-user`): Secure invitations with seat limit enforcement (hard block at 10 seats)
- ✅ **Accept Invitations** (`accept-invitation`): Race-condition safe invitation acceptance with double-seat-check
- ✅ **Member Management** (`manage-organization-members`): List/remove/role-change for org admins

**Revenue Protection Features Implemented:**
