## Session Overview
**Start Time:** 2025-07-25 07:32 AM

## Goals
- [x] Implement dynamic state/province dropdown population based on uploaded data

## Progress

### Implement Dynamic State/Province Dropdown âœ“
**Problem:** The state/province filter dropdown shows all possible states from LERG (449 NPAs) regardless of what's actually in the uploaded rate sheet. This creates confusion when users see Canadian provinces in the dropdown but their data contains no Canadian NPAs.

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Created new `fetchUniqueStatesFromData()` method in `useUSTableData.ts` that:
   - Queries the actual uploaded data in IndexedDB
   - Extracts unique NPAs from the data
   - Maps NPAs to state/province codes via LERG
   - Returns only states/provinces present in the uploaded data

2. Updated `USRateSheetTable.vue` to:
   - Use `fetchUniqueStatesFromData()` instead of `fetchUniqueStates()`
   - Refresh available states when data changes
   - Handle cases where selected state no longer exists after data update
   - Added proper cleanup in unmount lifecycle

**Technical Details:**
- Optimized query using `orderBy('npa')` for better performance with large datasets
- Added watcher on `store.lastDbUpdateTime` to refresh states when data changes
- Maintains existing filter functionality while making it context-aware

**Files Modified:**
- `/client/src/composables/tables/useUSTableData.ts`
- `/client/src/components/rate-sheet/us/USRateSheetTable.vue`

**Impact:** Users now see only relevant states/provinces in the dropdown based on their uploaded data, improving UX and preventing empty filter results.

### Update - 1:06 PM

**Issue:** Dropdown was not working - "No database instance available" error

**Fix Applied:**
1. Added database initialization check in `fetchUniqueStatesFromData()`
2. Added try-catch for `orderBy('npa')` with fallback to regular iteration
3. Added fallback to show all LERG states if error occurs
4. Ensured DB initialization on component mount before fetching states
5. Added fallback to load default LERG states when no data exists

**Result:** Dropdown now properly initializes and shows appropriate states based on context
