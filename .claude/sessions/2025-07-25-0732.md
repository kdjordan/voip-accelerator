# Development Session - 2025-07-25 07:32

## Session Overview
**Start Time:** 2025-07-25 07:32 AM

## Goals
- [x] Implement dynamic state/province dropdown population based on uploaded data

## Progress

### Implement Dynamic State/Province Dropdown ✓
**Problem:** The state/province filter dropdown shows all possible states from LERG (449 NPAs) regardless of what's actually in the uploaded rate sheet. This creates confusion when users see Canadian provinces in the dropdown but their data contains no Canadian NPAs.

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Created new `fetchUniqueStatesFromData()` method in `useUSTableData.ts` that:
   - Queries the actual uploaded data in IndexedDB
   - Extracts unique NPAs from the data
   - Maps NPAs to state/province codes via LERG
   - Returns only states/provinces present in the uploaded data

2. Updated `USRateSheetTable.vue` to:
   - Use `fetchUniqueStatesFromData()` instead of `fetchUniqueStates()`
   - Refresh available states when data changes
   - Handle cases where selected state no longer exists after data update
   - Added proper cleanup in unmount lifecycle

**Technical Details:**
- Optimized query using `orderBy('npa')` for better performance with large datasets
- Added watcher on `store.lastDbUpdateTime` to refresh states when data changes
- Maintains existing filter functionality while making it context-aware

**Files Modified:**
- `/client/src/composables/tables/useUSTableData.ts`
- `/client/src/components/rate-sheet/us/USRateSheetTable.vue`

**Impact:** Users now see only relevant states/provinces in the dropdown based on their uploaded data, improving UX and preventing empty filter results.

### Update - 1:06 PM

**Issue:** Dropdown was not working - "No database instance available" error

**Fix Applied:**
1. Added database initialization check in `fetchUniqueStatesFromData()`
2. Added try-catch for `orderBy('npa')` with fallback to regular iteration
3. Added fallback to show all LERG states if error occurs
4. Ensured DB initialization on component mount before fetching states
5. Added fallback to load default LERG states when no data exists

**Result:** Dropdown now properly initializes and shows appropriate states based on context

### Implement Dynamic State Dropdown for US Comparison Table ✓
**Time:** 1:18 PM

**Problem:** USDetailedComparisonTable showed all LERG states instead of only states present in the comparison data

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Reused existing `fetchUniqueStatesFromData()` method from `useUSTableData` composable
2. Updated component mount to:
   - Initialize DB if needed
   - Call `fetchUniqueStatesFromData()` instead of `fetchUniqueStates()`
3. Added watcher to refresh states when comparison data changes significantly
4. Added logic to reset selected state if it no longer exists in new data

**Files Modified:**
- `/client/src/components/us/USDetailedComparisonTable.vue`

**Impact:** Comparison table now shows only states that have matched data between the two compared files, providing a more intuitive filtering experience

### Update - 2025-07-25 1:22 PM

**Summary**: Implemented dynamic state/province dropdown population for both US Rate Sheet and US Comparison tables

**Git Changes**:
- Modified: .claude/sessions/2025-07-25-0732.md
- Modified: client/src/components/us/USDetailedComparisonTable.vue
- Previously modified: client/src/composables/tables/useUSTableData.ts, client/src/components/rate-sheet/us/USRateSheetTable.vue
- Current branch: dev (commit: 5c18c8d Implement dynamic state/province dropdown based on uploaded data)

**Todo Progress**: 6 completed, 0 in progress, 0 pending
- ✓ Completed: Analyze current state/province dropdown implementation
- ✓ Completed: Design dynamic state population based on uploaded data
- ✓ Completed: Fix database initialization issue
- ✓ Completed: Update USDetailedComparisonTable to use fetchUniqueStatesFromData

**Details**: 
Successfully implemented dynamic state/province dropdown population across both major US data tables. The dropdowns now intelligently show only states/provinces/countries that exist in the actual uploaded or comparison data, rather than showing all 449 LERG entries. This provides a much cleaner user experience and prevents confusion when filtering data. The implementation reuses the same pattern across both components for consistency and maintainability.
