# VoIP Accelerator - Stripe Billing Integration Plan

## Current Application Analysis

Based on your existing codebase, I can see:

- **Tech Stack**: Vue 3 + TypeScript + Supabase + Pinia stores
- **User Management**: Already implemented with Supabase auth (`user-store.ts`)
- **Core Features**: Rate sheet uploads, comparisons, analysis, exports
- **Architecture**: Well-structured with services, stores, and components

## Questions for Billing Strategy

### 1. Business Model
**What type of billing model do you prefer?**
- [ ] Subscription-based (monthly/annual plans)
- [ ] Usage-based (pay per upload/comparison)
- [ ] Freemium (free tier + paid features)
- [ ] Hybrid (subscription + usage overages)

### 2. Current Usage Tracking
I notice you have `userStore.incrementUploadsToday()` - **what usage limits do you want to enforce?**
- File uploads per day/month?
- Rate comparisons per period?
- Export operations?
- Storage/data retention?

### 3. Feature Tiers
**What features should be behind a paywall?**
- [ ] Basic rate comparisons (free?)
- [ ] Advanced analysis/reports (premium?)
- [ ] Export functionality (premium?)
- [ ] Bulk operations (enterprise?)
- [ ] Historical data retention (premium?)
- [ ] API access (enterprise?)

### 4. Pricing Structure
**What pricing tiers are you considering?**
- Free tier: ___ uploads/month, basic features
- Professional: $___/month, ___ uploads, advanced features  
- Enterprise: $___/month, unlimited, premium support

### 5. Integration Approach
**How do you want to handle billing flows?**
- [ ] Embedded Stripe Elements in your app
- [ ] Redirect to Stripe Checkout
- [ ] Customer portal for subscription management
- [ ] In-app billing management

### 6. Technical Implementation
**Where should billing be handled?**
- [ ] Client-side only (Stripe Elements)
- [ ] Supabase Edge Functions (recommended for webhooks)
- [ ] Separate backend service
- [ ] Hybrid approach

### 7. User Experience
**When should users hit billing prompts?**
- [ ] At registration (choose plan upfront)
- [ ] When hitting usage limits (soft/hard limits)
- [ ] When accessing premium features
- [ ] Optional upgrade prompts

### 8. Current User Data Integration
**How should billing integrate with your existing user system?**
- Store Stripe customer ID in Supabase profiles?
- Sync subscription status with user store?
- How to handle existing users?

## Technical Architecture Considerations

### Current User Store Structure
```typescript
// From user-store.ts - you already have:
- User profile management
- Upload tracking (incrementUploadsToday)
- Trial period handling
```

### Potential Integration Points
1. **User Store Enhancement** - Add subscription status, usage limits
2. **New Billing Service** - Handle Stripe operations
3. **Usage Tracking** - Enhance existing upload counting
4. **Feature Guards** - Protect premium features
5. **Billing Components** - Subscription cards, payment forms

### Supabase Integration
Your existing Supabase setup could handle:
- Webhook endpoints (Edge Functions)
- Subscription status storage
- Usage analytics
- Customer data sync
