Reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem, distill those down to 1-2 most likely sources, and then add logs to validate your assumptions before we move onto implementing the actual code fix.




 Reminder to add this git setting to your bash rc file:

git config --global branch.sort -committerdate

`git branch -l` lists alphabetically by default, so it's hard to find recent branches. This sorts by date instead!
