# LERG State/NPA Processing Implementation

## Overview

Add state-based NPA breakdown functionality to match special codes UI pattern, processing data efficiently using web workers and reactive store updates.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Type Definitions

- [x] Add StateNPAMapping interface (simple state -> NPAs[] mapping)
- [x] Update LergState interface to include state mappings
- [x] Add worker message types for state processing

### 2. Web Worker Setup

- [x] Create lerg-state.worker.ts
- [x] Implement state grouping using Map for efficiency
- [x] Add batch processing for large datasets
- [x] Add progress reporting
- [x] Add error handling

### 3. Store Updates

- [x] Add state mappings to store state
- [x] Add computed properties for state statistics (counts, sorting)
- [x] Add actions for updating state mappings
- [x] Add helper getters for UI display

### 4. Service Integration

- [x] Update lerg.service.ts to spawn worker
- [x] Handle worker responses
- [x] Update store with processed data
- [x] Integrate with existing IndexDB operations

### 5. UI Implementation

- [ ] Add LERG Database Details section
- [ ] Add expandable state rows
- [ ] Add NPA display for each state
- [ ] Match special codes styling
- [ ] Add loading states

### 6. Testing & Optimization

- [ ] Test with large datasets
- [ ] Verify worker performance
- [ ] Test UI responsiveness
- [ ] Optimize batch size
- [ ] Add error recovery

## Success Criteria

- Process state/NPA mappings without blocking UI
- Match special codes UI/UX
- Handle large datasets efficiently
- Maintain responsive interface
- Provide accurate state/NPA breakdowns
