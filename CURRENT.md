# Current Implementation Task

## Task: LERG Data Management

### Completed âœ…

1. File Processing:

   - Fixed file size limits (500MB)
   - Added proper error handling
   - Improved database schema
   - Fixed record processing

2. Special Area Codes:
   - Created special_area_codes table
   - Implemented CSV seeder
   - Added data migration
   - Successfully seeded reference data

### Next Steps ðŸ”„

1. LERG Processing Enhancements:

   - Add special area code validation during LERG processing
   - Cross-reference LERG NPAs with special_area_codes
   - Add country/province info to LERG records where applicable

2. API Endpoints:

   - Add endpoint to query special area codes
   - Add filtering by country/province
   - Include special area code info in LERG queries

3. UI Improvements:
   - Show country/province in LERG data display
   - Add special area code filtering options
   - Improve upload progress feedback

Would you like to work on any of these next steps? I'd suggest starting with the special area code validation during LERG processing since we now have the reference data available.
