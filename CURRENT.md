# LERG Data Processing Implementation

## Overview

Implement a robust server-side system for processing and storing LERG data files (>100MB), with progress tracking and error handling. The system should handle large text files efficiently using streaming, filter duplicates, and maintain data integrity.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. File Upload Infrastructure

- [x] Create file size validation (limit to 500MB)
- [x] Add file type validation (.txt only)
- [x] Implement basic drag-and-drop UI matching special codes
- [x] Add upload progress indicator
- [x] Create error handling for upload failures

### 2. Server Processing Setup

- [ ] Implement streaming file processing
- [ ] Add progress reporting to client
- [ ] Setup error handling and recovery
- [ ] Add memory-efficient processing
- [ ] Implement batch processing for large files

### 3. Data Processing

- [x] Implement text file parsing logic
- [x] Extract required fields (NPA, NXX, State)
- [x] Generate NPANXX combinations
- [x] Add duplicate detection and filtering
- [x] Implement progress calculation
- [ ] Add server-side data validation

### 4. Database Operations

- [ ] Create transaction wrapper for data replacement
- [ ] Implement table truncation
- [ ] Add batch insert operations
- [ ] Handle unique constraint violations
- [ ] Add error recovery for failed transactions
- [ ] Implement last_updated timestamp handling

### 5. IndexDB Integration

- [ ] Add IndexDB clear operation
- [ ] Implement new data fetch after upload
- [ ] Handle failed IndexDB operations
- [ ] Add progress tracking for IndexDB operations
- [ ] Implement error recovery

### 6. UI Components

- [ ] Create upload progress bar
- [ ] Add processing status indicators
- [ ] Implement error message display
- [ ] Add success confirmation
- [ ] Show processing statistics
- [ ] Display duplicate count

### 7. Testing & Validation

- [ ] Test with various file sizes
- [ ] Validate duplicate handling
- [ ] Test error scenarios
- [ ] Verify data integrity
- [ ] Test concurrent uploads
- [ ] Validate progress tracking

### 8. Performance Optimization

- [ ] Optimize chunk size
- [ ] Improve memory usage
- [ ] Enhance batch insert performance
- [ ] Optimize IndexDB operations
- [ ] Add performance monitoring

## Success Criteria

- Successfully process files up to 500MB
- Accurately filter and handle duplicates
- Maintain data integrity across PostgreSQL and IndexDB
- Provide clear progress feedback to users
- Handle errors gracefully with user feedback
- Complete processing in reasonable time
- Maintain application responsiveness during processing

## Notes

- Files are typically >100MB in size
- Server-side processing is required for efficiency
- Progress reporting needed for long-running operations
- Memory management is critical for large files
- Streaming approach needed for file processing
