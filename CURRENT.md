# Hybrid Storage Implementation Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step approach for implementing a configurable storage strategy that allows switching between in-memory (Pinia store) and IndexedDB (DexieJS) storage in our application.

## Phase 1: Setup and Foundation

- [x] **1.1** Create a storage configuration file
  - Create `src/config/storage-config.ts` with toggle for storage strategy
  - Add memory threshold and fallback configuration options

- [x] **1.2** Design storage strategy interface
  - Create `src/services/storage/storage-strategy.ts` with interface definition
  - Define core methods: storeData, getData, removeData, clearAllData

- [x] **1.3** Create abstract factory for storage strategies
  - Create `src/services/storage/storage-factory.ts`
  - Implement factory method to return appropriate strategy based on config

## Phase 2: Strategy Implementations

- [x] **2.1** Adapt existing DexieJS implementation to strategy pattern
  - Create `src/services/storage/dexie-strategy.ts` that wraps existing DexieJS code
  - Extract and adapt DexieJS operations from current services
  - Ensure 100% backward compatibility with existing functionality

- [x] **2.2** Implement Store strategy
  - Create `src/services/storage/store-strategy.ts`
  - Implement interface methods for Pinia store operations
  - Add necessary store modifications to handle data storage

- [x] **2.3** Add unit tests for both strategies
  - Test core operations for both strategies
  - Test strategy switching via factory

## Phase 3: AZ Module Integration

- [x] **3.1** Update AZService to use storage strategies
  - Modify service to accept a strategy
  - Refactor file processing to use the strategy
  - Maintain backward compatibility

- [x] **3.2** Update AZ store for in-memory storage
  - Add data structures for in-memory storage
  - Add necessary actions and getters

- [x] **3.3** Modify AZFileUploads.vue
  - Update components to use the new storage approach
  - Ensure report generation works with both strategies

- [x] **3.4** Test AZ module with both strategies
  - Verify file uploads with both strategies
  - Verify report generation with both strategies
  - Check memory usage in both scenarios

## Phase 4: US Module Integration

- [x] **4.1** Update USService to use storage strategies
  - Similar refactoring as with AZService
  - Ensure backward compatibility

- [x] **4.2** Update US store for in-memory storage
  - Add data structures for in-memory storage
  - Add necessary actions and getters

- [x] **4.3** Modify USFileUploads.vue
  - Update components to use the new storage approach
  - Ensure functionality works with both strategies

- [x] **4.4** Test US module with both strategies
  - Similar verification as with AZ module

## Phase 5: Performance and Optimization

- [x] **5.1** Implement memory monitoring (optional)
  - Create memory monitoring service
  - Add auto-switching based on memory thresholds
  - Add user notifications for strategy switching

- [x] **5.2** Add performance metrics
  - Track and log operation times for both strategies
  - Provide comparison data for making storage decisions

- [x] **5.3** Optimize chunking for large datasets
  - Implement batch processing for store strategy
  - Optimize memory usage for large file processing

## Phase 6: Integration and Documentation

- [x] **6.1** Add UI controls for storage strategy (optional)
  - Add settings UI for administrators
  - Allow manual switching between strategies

- [x] **6.2** Complete documentation
  - Document the strategy pattern implementation
  - Update technical specifications
  - Add usage guidelines for developers

- [ ] **6.3** Final integration testing
  - End-to-end testing with both strategies
  - Performance testing with large datasets
  - Browser compatibility testing

## Implementation Notes

- Each phase should be completed and tested before moving to the next
- Use feature branches for each major phase
- Maintain backward compatibility throughout the refactoring
- Run memory profiling regularly during implementation

## Completion Criteria

- Both storage strategies fully implemented and testable
- All existing functionality works with both strategies
- Transparent switching between strategies
- No regression in existing features
- Clear documentation for developers
