# VOIP Rate Analysis Service Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: File Upload System (Fundamentals)

- [x] Create upload UI components for US and AZ rate files
- [x] Implement file validation (CSV format)
- [x] Add drag-and-drop functionality
- [x] Implement preview modal to validate file content
- [x] Build column mapping interface for different file formats
- [x] Create storage mechanism in Pinia store
- [x] Fix US file upload component to properly store files in the Pinia store

## Phase 2: Data Processing & Basic Analysis

- [x] Implement basic rate file analysis:
  - [x] Count total NPA-NXX codes in each file
  - [x] Extract unique NPAs (area codes)
  - [x] Calculate rate statistics (min, max, avg) for each file - including interstate, intrastate, and indeterminate rates.
  - [x] Display summary of single file analysis
- [x] Create basic data visualization components

## Phase 3: File Comparison Features

- [ ] Complete comparison between two uploaded files:
  - [x] Create worker architecture for US code reports and comparison
  - [x] Implement enhanced code report with country and state breakdowns
  - [x] Create initial pricing report with rate comparisons
  - [ ] Identify overlapping NPA-NXX codes
  - [ ] Calculate gaps (codes in one file but not the other)
  - [ ] Create rate difference statistics
  - [ ] Calculate percentage differences
- [ ] Build comparison visualization components
- [ ] Implement filtering by:
  - [ ] Rate differences (higher/lower)
  - [ ] NPA (area code)
  - [ ] Rate ranges

## Phase 4: Advanced Features

- [ ] Add jurisdictional analysis:
  - [ ] Map NPAs to states/regions
  - [ ] Calculate state-level pricing statistics
  - [ ] Create regional visualization
- [ ] Implement LERG integration:
  - [ ] Import LERG database or API
  - [ ] Validate NPA-NXX combinations against LERG
  - [ ] Display rate center mappings
  - [ ] Flag invalid or outdated codes
- [ ] Performance optimizations for large files

## Phase 5: Reporting & Export

- [ ] Create comprehensive report interface:
  - [ ] Summary section
  - [ ] Pricing analysis
  - [ ] Code coverage analysis
  - [ ] Jurisdictional breakdown
- [ ] Implement export functionality:
  - [ ] Export comparison to CSV
  - [ ] Export visualization data
  - [ ] Generate PDF reports

## Phase 6: UI/UX Refinements

- [ ] Add progress indicators for long operations
- [ ] Implement contextual help and tooltips
- [ ] Create onboarding guide for first-time users
- [ ] Add responsive design for different device sizes
- [ ] Implement user preferences/settings

## Phase 7: Testing & Optimization

- [ ] Comprehensive testing with large files
- [ ] Browser compatibility testing
- [ ] Performance profiling and optimization
- [ ] User acceptance testing

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Complete the US pricing report worker for comparing NPA-level rates
2. Improve the styling and functionality of the enhanced code report
3. Add filtering and sorting to the pricing comparison
