# LERG Data Processing Implementation

## Overview

Implement a robust server-side system for processing and storing LERG data files (>100MB), with progress tracking and error handling. The system should handle large text files efficiently using streaming, filter duplicates, and maintain data integrity.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. File Upload Infrastructure

- [x] Create file size validation (limit to 500MB)
- [x] Add file type validation (.txt only)
- [x] Implement basic drag-and-drop UI matching special codes
- [x] Add upload progress indicator
- [x] Create error handling for upload failures
- [x] Add confirmation dialog for data replacement

### 2. Server Processing Setup

- [x] Implement streaming file processing
- [x] Add progress reporting to client
- [x] Setup error handling and recovery
- [x] Add memory-efficient processing
- [x] Implement batch processing for large files

### 3. Data Processing

- [x] Implement text file parsing logic
- [x] Extract required fields (NPA, NXX, State)
- [x] Generate NPANXX combinations
- [x] Add duplicate detection and filtering
- [x] Implement progress calculation
- [x] Add server-side data validation

### 4. Database Operations

- [x] Create transaction wrapper for data replacement
- [x] Implement table truncation
- [x] Add batch insert operations
- [x] Handle unique constraint violations
- [x] Add error recovery for failed transactions
- [x] Implement last_updated timestamp handling
- [x] Optimize schema (npanxx as PRIMARY KEY)
- [x] Add appropriate indexes

### 5. IndexDB Integration

- [ ] Add IndexDB clear operation
- [x] Implement new data fetch after upload
- [x] Handle failed IndexDB operations
- [x] Add progress tracking for IndexDB operations
- [x] Implement error recovery

### 6. UI Components

- [x] Create upload progress bar
- [x] Add processing status indicators
- [x] Implement error message display
- [x] Add success confirmation
- [x] Show processing statistics
- [x] Display duplicate count
- [x] Add confirmation dialog for data replacement

### 7. Testing & Validation

- [x] Test with various file sizes
- [x] Validate duplicate handling
- [x] Test error scenarios
- [x] Verify data integrity
- [x] Test concurrent uploads
- [x] Validate progress tracking

### 8. Performance Optimization

- [x] Optimize chunk size
- [x] Improve memory usage
- [x] Enhance batch insert performance
- [x] Optimize database schema
- [x] Add appropriate indexes
- [x] Add performance monitoring

## Success Criteria

- Successfully process files up to 500MB
- Accurately filter and handle duplicates
- Maintain data integrity across PostgreSQL and IndexDB
- Provide clear progress feedback to users
- Handle errors gracefully with user feedback
- Complete processing in reasonable time
- Maintain application responsiveness during processing

## Notes

- Files are typically >100MB in size
- Server-side processing is required for efficiency
- Progress reporting needed for long-running operations
- Memory management is critical for large files
- Streaming approach needed for file processing
- NPANXX is primary key for efficient lookups
- Database schema optimized for performance
- User confirmation required for data replacement
